         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:59609:8"/>Servant, who hath the good Fortune to Conduct them into the World, and to extract thoſe purer Streams of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, which are ſeparated from the leſs diſcerning Part of Mankind, by polite Apologies and Florid Complimental Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, It will be the greater Happineſs, that I have the Honour to be Juſt to the Author and Serviceable to the World; But much more, that I have at the ſame time, ſo Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable an Opportunity of expreſſing my Gratitude for the Favours which Your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> hath already been pleaſed to beſtow on me: Favours, which are much more valuable, becauſe Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi>'s; and which carry with them a double Obligation of Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; the One to Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> and the Other to my good Friend and Worthy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron Dr. <hi>Robert Angell,</hi> to whom I am infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely Obliged for Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi>'s Favour, and for being firſt made known to Your <hi>Lordſhip.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it will not be the only Happineſs to me, that Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> is pleaſed to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize
<pb facs="tcp:59609:9"/>my preſent Undertaking; but it may in a great Meaſure Contribute to their Candid Acceptance by the World, who will put a higher Value upon them, for Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi>'s Favourable Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, were it Generally receiv'd and agreed on, what ſome People hold, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Philoſophy</hi> is prejudicial to <hi>Religion;</hi> I ſhould have more Reaſon to beg Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi>'s Pardon, than Your Patronage; ſince it muſt be in Vain to hope, that One, who promotes the Latter, by Inſtructive Doctrin; and what is more, an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Life, to be imitated, but not paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell'd; ſhould encourage any thing, that may be of Diſſervice to that: But I need not tell Your <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> that the Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Author hath made it appear, That we may ſearch into <hi>Efficient Cauſes,</hi> without denying the. All-Wiſe <hi>Author</hi> of Created Beings, his juſt Attributes: For, whoever diligently ſearches into <hi>Efficient Cauſes,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but diſcern the Neceſſity of an Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
<pb facs="tcp:59609:9"/>Creator, who firſt eſtabliſh'd the Laws of Nature, and gave them their due Limits; and our Author having made it evident, that <hi>Efficients</hi> themſelves, direct us to <hi>Final Cauſes;</hi> and confequently rather diſpoſe and incline a Man, than hinder him from being a Good <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> needs no other Inducements to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote it.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, were I not ſatisfy'd, that <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> if rightly made uſe of, by the Effects it hath upon my Self, did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Me the more to diſcern the Shortneſs of the Utmoſt Attainments of Finite Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, and to adore what I cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend; I ſhould be ſo far from deſiring Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi>'s Patronage, that I ſhould be ready to oppoſe it my ſelf, to the utmoſt of my Weak Endeavours: And were it not too ſoon to make Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> Promiſes, before I have qualify'd my Self to write any thing of my own, worth Your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi>'s Notice, I ſhould not be backwards to ſay, That I may in a few Years, ſhew
<pb facs="tcp:59609:10"/>that it will afford us no ſmall Light in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Creation, in directing us to frame ſome faint Ideas of the Methods by which the Omnipotent <hi>Fiat</hi> brought the World to what it now is, and to prove the Works of the Omnipotent Creator, as Hiſtorically deliver'd by <hi>Moſes,</hi> conſonant with <hi>Philoſophy.</hi>

                  <p>But I am afraid, that, endeavouring to make an Apology for this Dedication, I ought to make another, for having been too tedious already; ſince Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi>'s own Judgment, will ſatisfie You of the Uſefulneſs of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> and ſince that Conſideration is enough to induce You to encourage it.</p>
                  <p>Yet I cannot perſwade My ſelf, ſo ſoon to paſs by this Opportunity of expreſſing my Gratitude to Your <hi>Lordſhip:</hi> nor can I forbear reflecting on my own Happineſs, under Your <hi>Lordſhip's</hi> Patronage: For as no one better underſtands, how to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the Endeavours of thoſe, that make Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements
<pb facs="tcp:59609:10"/>in Knowledge their Aim, than thoſe that are moſt intimately acquainted with it, and than Your <hi>Lordſhip;</hi> So it is an equal Happineſs to be under the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Favourable Eye, of a Patron ſo deſirable: Neither is it any Vain Opinion I have of my own Merit, that makes me think my ſelf Happy under ſuch a Patron, but rather the Senſe of my own Weakneſs; for could I perſwade my ſelf that I deſerv'd Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi>'s Favour, or the Favour of ſome Others, both eminent and Learned, to whom I am oblig'd: I muſt be very vain indeed.</p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding the Senſe I have of my own Weakneſs, Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi>'s Favour will encourage me to improve the ſmall Talent I have, ſince in the Search of <hi>Truth,</hi>

                  <p>But My <hi>LORD,</hi> the World, who are wont to find in <hi>Dedications,</hi> the Characters of their <hi>Patrons,</hi> may wonder that I have declin'd the Uſual Method, ſince any one that knows Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> cannot want Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials for a Character, that might be of Uſe to the World, in ſetting them a Good Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern to imitate: Yet ſince Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi>'s Character would be drawn amiſs by ſo mean a Pen as Mine; I would rather be thought out of the Common Road, than miſtaken in it; ſince any Body that knows what Character belongs to a Truly <hi>Apoſtolical Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,</hi> is not unacquainted with Your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi>'s: Therefore ſince no <hi>Encomiums</hi> can add to that which can only be augmented by a Continuance of Your Life; the Fear of Miſ-repreſenting, is the Reaſon I decline it.</p>
                  <p>But not to take up too many of Your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi>'s pretious Minutes, which are always Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in doing Good, and promoting <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity</hi> in it's Original Stream; that Your

                           </note>BUT becauſe this Notion about the Nature of <hi>Qualities</hi> may be of ſome importance, I ſhall illuſtrate it a little further. We may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider then, That whoever was the firſt Inventor of <hi>Locks</hi> and <hi>Keys,</hi> they both conſiſted of a piece of Iron, of a determinate Figure; but in reſpect of the Congruity betwixt the Wards of the <hi>Locks,</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>Keys,</hi> they each of them obtained new Capacities; it being a peculiar Faculty of the <hi>Key</hi> to unlock, as of the <hi>Lock</hi> to be unlocked by it; yet by theſe new Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, no real or Phyſical Entities were added, either to the <hi>Lock</hi> or <hi>Key:</hi> ſo thoſe Qualities, which we call Senſible, tho' by virtue of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity or Incongruity in point of Figure or Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to our Senſories, the portions of Matter they modifie, are enabled to produce various Effects, upon whoſe account we make Bodies to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with Qualities, yet they are not in thoſe Bodies any real diſtinct Entities, or different from the Matter it ſelf, furniſhed with ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Bigneſs, Shape, or other Mechanical Modifications. It is reckoned amongſt the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Properties of <hi>Gold,</hi> that it is diſſoluble in <hi>Aqua Regis;</hi> and if one ſhould invent another <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> that will in part diſſolve pure <hi>Gold,</hi> yet the Nature of <hi>Gold</hi> is not at all different now, from what it was before either of thoſe <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruums</hi> were invented, there no new real En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities accruing to it, without the Intervention
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59609:22"/>of a Phyſical Change in the Body it ſelf, by the Addition of theſe Attributes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Proved by <hi>Phyſical</hi> Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note>There are ſome Bodies neither <hi>Cathartick,</hi> nor <hi>Sudorifick,</hi> with ſome of which <hi>Gold,</hi> being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied, acquires a Purging Virtue, and with others <hi>Diaphoretick</hi> Qualities; and Nature her ſelf doth, either Artificially, or by Chance, produce ſo many things, that have new Relations unto others: And, <hi>Art</hi> eſpecially aſſiſted by <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> may, by variouſly diſſipating Natural Bodies, or compounding either them or their conſtituent Parts with one another, form a multitude of new Productions, which will be able each of them to cauſe new Effects, either immediately upon our Senſories, or upon other Bodies, whoſe changes we are not able to perceive; ſo that no Man can know, but that the moſt Familiar Bodies, may have a multitude of Qualities, that he dreams not of; and a conſidering Man will hardly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, That ſo numerous a crowd of real Phyſical Entities can accrew to a Body, whilſt in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all our Senſes it remains unchanged.</p>
                        <p>Again, <hi>Glaſs</hi> beaten is commonly reckoned amongſt Poyſons, which deleterious Faculty is no ſuperadded Entity diſtinct from the <hi>Glaſs,</hi> but depends on the ſharp Points and cutting Edges of the Fragments, which by <hi>Mechanical</hi> Affections, cut and wound the Membranes of the Stomach and Guts; from whence follow great Gripings and Contorſions, and often a Bloody Flux by the Perforations of the Capillary Veſſels, and horrid Convulſions by the conſent of the Brain and <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> as alſo great Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, occaſioned by the loſs of Blood: And that thoſe Effects depend on the Edges and Points of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59609:22"/>the Fragments, appears, becauſe when the Guts are ſufficiently lined with Slime, or the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles of the <hi>Glaſs</hi> are ground fine, they paſs without damage along with the Execrements.</p>
                        <p>And this may put us in mind, That the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of Qualities, in the ſame Natural Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, may proceed from the bare Texture, and other <hi>Mechanical</hi> Affections of its Matter: For every Body is to be conſidered not barely as an entire diſtinct Portion of Matter; but as it is a Part of the Univerſe, placed amongſt a great number and variety of other Bodies, upon which it may Act, and by which it may be Acted on, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ways, which are falſly thought to be diſtinct Powers or Qualities in the Bodies, by which thoſe Actions and Paſſions are produced. And every Portion of Matter thus conſidered a few <hi>Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical</hi> Affections are ſufficient to diverſify it from other Bodies: As in a <hi>Watch,</hi> there are a great many Qualities; as to ſhew the Hours, to ſtrike, to give an Alarm, or to ſhew the Age of the <hi>Moon</hi> and Tides; yet theſe are all to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the determinate Shape and Texture of the Parts of it, and the Motion of the Spring. So the <hi>Sun</hi> hath a Power to harden Clay, and ſoften Wax, to melt Butter, and thaw Ice, and a great many more, which ſeem contrary Effects; yet theſe are not diſtinct Faculties in the <hi>Sun,</hi> but the Productions of <hi>Heat</hi> diverſify'd, by the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Textures of Bodies it chances to work upon.</p>
                        <p>And thus much <hi>(Pyrophilus)</hi> may ſerve to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Miſtake, That every thing Men are wont to call a Quality, muſt needs be a Real and <hi>Phyſical Entity.</hi> To conclude this <hi>Excurſion,</hi> I
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59609:23"/>ſhall add this ſhort Advertiſement, That to make what I have declared more intelligible, I have ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther done it by Examples, than Definitions; the latter being more difficult, becauſe of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of aſſigning the true <hi>Genus</hi>'s of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.

                        <p>Here it may not be amiſs to take Notice, That <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf does not only define <hi>Accidents,</hi> without ſetting down their <hi>Genus;</hi> but when he comes to define <hi>Qualities,</hi> tells us, That <hi>Quality</hi> is that by which a Thing is ſaid to be <hi>Qualis;</hi> which is to define the <hi>Thing</hi> by the <hi>Same,</hi> without denoting its <hi>Genus;</hi> for 'tis ſuppoſed to be as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle known what <hi>Qualis</hi> is, as what <hi>Qualitas.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, 'tis a Doubt whether it be not as falſe as obſcure; for to the Queſtion <hi>Qualis res est,</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer may be made out of ſome, if not all of the other <hi>Praedicaments of Accidents.</hi>

                           <item>2. The Knowledge we have of the Operations of Bodies, proceeds from ſome Senſible Quality, or ſome more <hi>Catholick</hi> Affection of Matter; as Motion, Reſt, or Texture; generated, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd in one of them.</item>
                           <item>3. We are to conſider every diſtinct Body that affects our Senſes, not as a bare Lump of Matter,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59609:24"/>of that Bigneſs and outward Shape that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears of, moſt of them having their Parts cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly contriv'd, and in Motion too. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we are to conſider the Univerſe that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounds us, as a great <hi>Engine,</hi> with no Vacuity, or no conſiderable one betwixt its Parts; and the Actions of Particular Bodies, are not to be eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, as if two Portions of Matter of their Bulk and Figure, were plac'd in ſome Imaginary Space beyond the World, but as ſituated in the World, as now conſtituted, and their Actions liable to be promoted, or hinder'd, or modify'd by the Actions of other Bodies about them; for it is not giving of a Concave <hi>Speculum,</hi> that Figure, that enables it to burn Wood, or melt Metals; but the Sun-Beams thrown together into a Point, by the help of that Concavity. And to ſhew how various and different Effects the ſame Action of a <hi>Natural Agent</hi> may produce, according to the ſeveral Diſpoſitions of the Bodies it works upon, we may conſider, That tho' in two <hi>Eggs,</hi> the one Prolifick, the other Barren, before <hi>Incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,</hi> the Senſe can diſtinguiſh no Difference; yet their internal Diſpoſition is ſo different, that if they be both expos'd to an equal Degree of Heat, the one will be chang'd into a putrid <hi>Fetid</hi> Subſtance, and the other into a <hi>Chick,</hi> furniſh'd with a variety of Organical Parts of very cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Textures.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>4. I grant that Bodies may have thoſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities we call <hi>Senſible,</hi> tho' there were no Animals in the World, every Body having ſuch a Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of its Conſtituent <hi>Corpuſcles,</hi> which duly apply'd to the Senſory of an Animal, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a Senſible Quality, which another would

                           <item>3. That both the <hi>Minima Naturalia,</hi> and thoſe Primary Cluſters reſulting from the <hi>Coalition</hi> of them, having their determinate Bulk and Shape; when theſe are united, the Size and Shape by their <hi>Juxta-poſition</hi> muſt be often altered, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times their Tendency in and to Motion vary'd; which <hi>Accidents</hi> will alſo happen when they are diſ-joyn'd, by which Unions and Separation of Parts, the Size and Shape being variouſly altered, they are accordingly adapted to ſeveral Pores, upon which Account they have different Effects upon ſeveral Bodies.</item>
                           <item>4. That when ſeveral of theſe <hi>Corpuſcles</hi> are aſſociated, and put into Motion, that Motion will produce great Alterations, and many new Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities in the Bodies they compoſe; as Air ſwiftly moved, is call'd <hi>Wind,</hi> and feels colder to the Touch; and <hi>Iron</hi> rubb'd againſt <hi>Wood,</hi> feels warm. But beſides theſe Inviſible Alterations, there are ſeveral which are viſible; as when the Particles, by knocking together, are broke and diſ-joyn'd, and by that means acquire new Forms, their Bulk and Figure being altered, and the <hi>Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>Interſtices</hi> of the Parts being alſo vary'd: Thus <hi>Water</hi> froze, acquires Firmneſs, and loſes its Tranſparency; and <hi>Milk,</hi> by a languid inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin Motion of its Parts, in hot Weather, turns into a thinner Liquor, and into <hi>Cream,</hi> which agitated in a <hi>Churn,</hi> turns to an Oyly Subſtance, and a thin fluid.

                           <item>5.

                     <p>HAVING ſaid thus much of the <hi>Qualities</hi> of <hi>Bodies</hi> in General, I now proceed to Particulars: And here I ſhall not ſpend Time in reckoning up all the Different Significations of the Word <hi>Quality;</hi> ſince what follows will explain, what Senſe we uſe it in: I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only in ſhort intimate, That ſeveral things have been accounted Qualities,<note place="margin">Primary Modes <hi>of</hi> Matter, <hi>and</hi> Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>of</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken for</hi> Real Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</note> which ſeem ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to be Complexions of them; as <hi>Inanimal, Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, Health</hi> and <hi>Beauty;</hi> the laſt of which ſeems to be the Reſult of <hi>Symmetry</hi> and <hi>Complexion,</hi> with Agreeable and Delightful Colours. There are other States of Matter alſo, as <hi>Rest</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Size</hi> and <hi>Shape,</hi> uſually call'd <hi>Qualities,</hi> which are rather to be accounted Primary Modes of Matter. But this concerning Names rather than Things, I ſhall (waving the uſual Diviſions of <hi>Qualities</hi>) treat of them according to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diviſion: <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, I ſhall conſider them under two Heads; to wit, <hi>Manifest</hi> and <hi>Occult Qualities;</hi> the former of which we ſhall divide <gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">

                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:59609:28"/>gredients of a Body, is evident; ſince Water <hi>Hermetically</hi> Sealed, being froze, inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Fluidity and Tranſparency, becomes Brittle, Firm, and ſometimes Opacous; which Qualities upon a Thaw it again loſes. Alſo fixt Metal, barely by being hammer'd, becomes brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; which Quality it preſently loſes, when heated in the Fire. And Silver, by being hammer'd, puts on Qualities, which it by no means had when cold; as a Power to melt ſome Bodies, and to dry others; with ſeveral others, which it only acquires, by Virtue of the inviſible Agitation of its Parts, put into Motion, by hammering.</p>
                     <p>I might add ſeveral Inſtances of this Kind, but having mention'd them in other ſucceeding Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters, I ſhall omit them here; and paſs to</p>
                     <p>The Third Conſideration, which hath been prov'd in the preceding Chapter; which is, That we are not to conſider the Effects of Mix'd Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as the bare Reſult of the Parts of Matter of ſuch a determinate Texture; but as plac'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other Bodies, on which they may vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly act, and be acted on.</p>
                     <p>But Fourthly, to remove this Objection, we muſt conſider, That the <hi>Peripatetick,</hi> as well as <hi>Chymical</hi> Principles, are incapable of accounting for the various <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, which the Corpuſcular Philoſophy hath a greater Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in: For neither the different Colours of the Planets, nor the Generation and Periſhing of Spots in the Sun, are to be accounted for by the Doctrin of the <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> nor <hi>Chymiſts;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſeveral <hi>Phaenomena</hi> relating to <hi>Magnetiſm, Muſick, Dioptricks, Catoptricks</hi> and <hi>Staticks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And indeed, I ſhould think it not a little
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59609:28"/>ſtrange, that the various Textures,<note place="margin">The Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents</hi> and <hi>Patients</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſify the <hi>Actions.</hi>
                        </note> as well as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Bodies, would not more ſufficiently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, than the Coſideration of Quieſcent Ingredients; for as all Natural Bodies, act on one another by Motion; ſo that Motion is variouſly determin'd, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the different Textures of the Agents and Patients.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed to the Second Objection againſt the <hi>Corpuſcularian Philoſophy;</hi> which is,<note place="margin">A Second Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Corpuſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larian Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd.</note> That it is impoſſible, ſo great a variety of Qualities ſhould ariſe from ſo few Principles, as Matter and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In anſwer to this, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew, that it is poſſible thoſe <hi>Catholick</hi> Affections of Matter, ſhould be deriv'd from Local Motion; and that thoſe Principles being variouſly combin'd and joyn'd together, ſhould afford <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> as various as any to be obſerv'd in Nature.</p>
                     <p>And Firſt; If we allow what is undeniable, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Tendency of Matter, as to Motion, is different in ſeveral Parts of the Univerſe; it will follow, that by <hi>Local Motion</hi> ſo diverſify'd, Matter muſt be divided into Parts diſtinct from one another; and conſequently, being Finite, muſt neceſſarily have a determinate <hi>Size,</hi> as well as <hi>Shape:</hi> And ſince all the Univerſal Bulk of Matter, hath not its Parts in a conſtant Motion, ſome of them, being intangl'd together, muſt needs be at Reſt. And hence the Primary Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of Matter flow.</p>
                     <p>But there are yet other Affections of Matter, belonging to the leſſer Fragments of it, in Reſpect of their Situation, as <hi>Poſture,</hi> either Horizontal, Erect, or Inclining, in reference to our Horizon; and alſo a peculiar <hi>Order,</hi> in Relation to each
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59609:29"/>other; the Union of which Parts collectively conſider'd, may properly be call'd <hi>Texture,</hi> or <hi>Modification.</hi> And ſince moſt Bodies are made up of Parts ſomething Irregular; it is impoſſible but that there ſhould be Interſtices, or <hi>Pores</hi> left betwixt them. And further, ſome Parts of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, being very ſubtile and fine, and eaſily put into Motion by Heat, or other proper Agents; ſuch Bodies cannot but emit good ſtore of <hi>Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viums.</hi> And when Particles of Matter are fitted and adapted, ſo as to adhere together, they form thoſe ſimilar Bodies, call'd <hi>Elements,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mix'd with one another, conſtitute Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Bodies; which being again aſſociated with Compounds, form Bodies, ſtill more Complex; which Compounding and Decompounding of Bodies,<note place="margin">The Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and <hi>Texture.</hi>
                        </note> may be Properly call'd <hi>Mixture;</hi> which differs from <hi>Texture,</hi> becauſe it implies a Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneity of Parts, which the latter does not.

Letters; it will not be hard to think, that ſo many different Modes of Matter may ariſe from ſuch Finite Principles, as could Reaſonably be ſuppos'd to reſult from the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Aſſociations of thoſe ten Letters.</p>
                     <p>And indeed, an inaccountable Number more: ſince every one of theſe Principles admits of an
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59609:29"/>Incredible Variety. As firſt, there may be a vaſt Variety of <hi>Aſſociations</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>Figure</hi> or Number, or Order of the Parts joyn'd; as in Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, ſome may be Triangles or Squares, others Pentagons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There may alſo another Variety proceed from the Different <hi>Shapes</hi> and <hi>Sizes</hi> of the Parts of Matter united; their Figures being either Spherical, like a Bullet, Elliptical, like an Egg, or Cubical, as a Dye, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> together with a great many others: Examples of which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Carvers, Gravers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> afford; thoſe Tools being not only of different Sizes, but alſo various Shapes. And there is no leſs Variety in the Degrees of Motion; ſince Motion may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely different in Swiftneſs or Slowneſs, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity or Difformity; as alſo, according to the different Lines in which Bodies move, as Streight, Circular, Hyperbolical, Ellyptical, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the differently Figur'd Parts they ſtrike againſt; to which Cauſes of Variety, may be added the different Sizes or Shapes of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies mov'd: as alſo, the ſeveral Degrees of Compound Bodies, and the different Modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their Ingredients; and likewiſe of the <hi>Mediums</hi> through which they move, as well as the Degreess of Impulſe. And the Effects of theſe may be vary'd again, according to the different Situation or Determinate Natures of the Bodies they ſtrike againſt.</p>

                        </note>And, that Motion is able to produce a vaſt Variety of Effects, we may learn from Muſical Inſtruments; where according to the Difference of the Air's Motion, ariſing from the various Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brations of the Strings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> different Sounds are produced; which, as they are more or leſs co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incident

                     <p>But it would be too tedious to mention all the Diverſities which might happen in <hi>Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> by the various Combinations of our Ten Principles; and therefore, ſince from hence their Fertility may ſufficiently appear, I ſhall proceed to</p>

                        <note place="margin">A Third <hi>Objection</hi> anſwered.</note>The laſt Difficulty raiſed againſt the <hi>Corpuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Philoſophy,</hi> which is, That if the <hi>Qualities</hi> of Bodies depend on the <hi>Size, Shape</hi> and <hi>Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> of Bodies, all Bodies of the ſame Colours muſt have the ſame <hi>Textures;</hi> and if the ſame <hi>Textures;</hi> the ſame <hi>Qualities</hi> in other reſpects: But we ſee it is contrary, ſince the Calx of <hi>Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn</hi> is inſipid, and yet the Volatile Salt of <hi>Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn</hi> is very ſtrong Scented, and of as ſtrong a Taſte: To which a great many more Examples might be added were it neceſſary.</p>

                           <hi>Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Difficulty.</note>But I ſhall rather, ſince it is not requiſite, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the following Conſiderations to remove the Difficulty.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That ſeveral Heterogeneous Parts may be lodged in the Pores of a Body, which tho' of a different Nature from the Body it ſelf, yet they may produce ſome conſiderable Effects; as in Perfumed Gloves, the Odoriferous Parts are both different in Subſtance, and have diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Qualities from the Leather the Gloves are made of.</p>
                     <p>The Second Conſideration is, That Parts of very different Natures may be linked together, not in an Eſſential Structure, but a Juxta-Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Peculiar kind of Compoſition, and yet afford the ſame Qualities, notwithſtanding their
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59609:30"/>Eſſential Differences; for inviſible changes in ſome Parts of Matter, may be ſufficient to cauſe new Qualities, tho' the Eſſential Parts of thoſe Bodies be unaltered; and not only ſo, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſified enough to denominate them of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Species. So a Bar of Iron, by being ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer'd, may feel hot, though there be no viſible alteration in the Nature of the Metal by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe Agitation of the Inſenſible Parts of it.</p>
                     <p>But to illuſtrate this Conſideration a little further; tho' a Piece of Iron, Wood or Tin, ſhould have ſharp protuberant Parts, yet are they diſtinct Subſtances, notwithſtanding they all agree in that Quality of Roughneſs; and if thoſe rough Parts were worn off, and the Body endowed with a ſmooth Quality, yet ſtill would they in reſpect of their Subſtance, remain unaltered: And tho' the ſuperficies of Steel, Braſs, Flint or Marble ſhould be poliſhed as to become Specular, their Eſſential Differences would ſtill be the ſame. And as I took notice before, tho' Air be put into an Undulating Motion by different Inſtruments, yet if the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be raiſed to the ſame degree, it cauſes the ſame Sound, and produces the ſame Note. So that Bodies may agree in ſome Extra-Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Attributes, and yet be different in their Eſſential Modifications: To confirm the Truth of which, Heat will afford us an Eminent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, which may be produc'd in a Body, by putting its Parts into Agitation, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the Eſſential Properties of the Body ſo affected: So that the Eſſential Nature of a Body may not be concern'd in reflecting the Rays of Light, which produce thoſe Extra-Eſſential
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59609:31"/>Qualities, which are called <hi>Colours;</hi> ſince to produce Whiteneſs in a Body, it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, that the Surface of that Body be ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dified, as to reflect the Rays of Light copiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and undiſturbed, whatever the Eſſential and proper Texture of that Body is.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Different-<hi>Qualities</hi> afforded by <hi>Bodies Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneous</hi> as to <hi>Senſe.</hi>
                        </note>And here it may be proper to take notice, that there are ſeveral Bodies Homogeneous as to Senſe, which afford different Qualities; as <hi>Salt-Peter,</hi> becomes fluid and tranſparent, when briskly agitated in a Crucible; whereas it hath other Qualities when cool, being a hard and white brittle Subſtance: And the Powder of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labaſter</hi> being duly expoſed to a convenient heat, acquires ſeveral Qualities not different from thoſe of fluid Bodies. So <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> although it be tranſparent and clear, yet if rais'd in the form of Fumes, it puts on a red Colour.</p>
                     <p>The Third thing I would propoſe to remove this difficulty is, what hath been ſeveral times hinted before, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Body is not to be conſidered barely as a determinate Subſtance, but as a part of the Univerſe, and placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other Bodies.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59609:32"/>ſharp and cauſtick if applied to an Excoriated Part; beſides which Qualities, they likewiſe make the Eyes water, and cauſe Sneezing.

They diſſolve Copper, yet deſtroy the Corroſive Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of other Acid Menſtruums; and precipitate the Copper when diſſolved by them: Yet if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Salt be aſſociated with it, this Salt ceaſes to produce moſt of the forementioned Effects, and forms a Body very like <hi>Sal Armoniack:</hi> which change may probably depend on the Motion and Shape of its Parts deſtroyed, ſince by Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating moſt of the Liquor, I have found the Salt not only much leſs Fugitive and Volatile than that of Urine, but the Cryſtals of a different Figure, being like Combs and Feathers.

                     <p>Theſe Conſiderations, together with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra-Eſſential Changes of Bodies, may let us ſee, that Subſtances may work variouſly upon dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Senſes as well as other Bodies; and thoſe Effects too, may depend on Extra-Eſſential Changes, which may be wrought in Motion, Shape and Texture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Eſſential Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difications of Bodies nevertheleſs agreeing.

But not to examine all their Various Opinions on this Point, I ſhall only here briefly conſider the Opinion of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Ariſtotelians,</hi> having already in our Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis laid down in the foregoing Chapter, our Thoughts on this Subject.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Doctrin of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotelians</hi> conſidered.</note>The Controverſie betwixt us and the Schools is this, <hi>Whether the Forms of Natural Bodies be eduted out of the Power of the Matter, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be substantial Entities diſtinct from Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</hi> That they are not, appears from what is contained in the foregoing Chapters; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what I ſhall here inſiſt on is, that the Doctrin of the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> is to me <hi>Incomprehenſible;</hi> for tho' the Schoolmen make uſe of an Obſcure Diſtinction, <hi>viz.</hi> That in producing <hi>Forms,</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of Matter is partly <hi>Eductive,</hi> and partly <hi>Receptive;</hi> yet ſince they deny Forms, to exiſt in Matter; it is hard to conceive how they
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59609:33"/>ſhould be educed, before exiſtent: And ſince the Receptive Power, only enables Matter to receive a Form, how can it help to produce it, when the Form muſt be produced before the Receptive Power can lodge it?</p>
                     <p>It is manifeſt, that the Body hath a Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power in Relation to the Soul,<note place="margin">

                     <p>But they tell us ſtrange things of the Efficacy of the Agent, which works upon the Matter out of which Forms are to be educed: To which it may be briefly anſwered, That the Agent can only act as a Phyſical Agent; and if the Form produced by it's Operation, be a Subſtance not preexiſtent in that Matter it works upon, and which conſtitutes the Body, the Form muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59609:33"/>be made of ſome Parts of that Matter, or created <hi>de novo;</hi> if they allow the former, then the Form is not a Subſtance diſtinct from Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but if they will not allow it to be made of Matter, it muſt be <hi>de novo, i. e.</hi> out of nothing; which being granted, Natural Bodies muſt be produced by Creation and Generation, and not by the latter only; and it's ſtrange if they allow that a Phyſical Agent can effect that, which Antient Philoſophers thought too great to be aſcribed to God himſelf.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totelian</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of <hi>Forms</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Reaſon.</note>And as for theſe Reaſons, what they ſay of the Origin of Forms, is to me <hi>Incomprehenſible;</hi> ſo, that what they deliver concerning Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Forms is irreconcilable to Reaſon: For though they allow theſe Forms to be Subſtances, yet they teach, that they depend upon Matter, both <hi>in fieri</hi> and <hi>in eſſe: i. e.</hi> they cannot exiſt out of the Matter which ſupports them; which is to give them the Name of Subſtances, but the Nature of Accidents. Nay, theſe imaginary Forms as much invalidate the Doctrin of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, as that of Generation; for if a Form be a Subſtance diſtinct from Matter, it muſt exiſt of it ſelf, as the Soul of Man does, when the Body is diſſolved: But they aſſert, that in Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption the Form ceaſeth to exiſt; by which means they make it an Accident, and likewiſe contradict what they commonly hold, <hi>viz.</hi> That upon Corruption Bodies are reſolved into their firſt Principles; ſince if what they aſſert of Forms be true, Bodies are but partly diſſolved into their firſt Matter, and partly annihilated or reſtored to the common Stock of Forms; which, notwithſtanding any thing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, muſt be immortal.</p>

                           <hi>Arguments</hi> alledged by the Schools in defence of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note>But to examine ſome of the moſt Plauſible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments brought by the Schools to evince their Doctrin of Forms: Firſt, they argue thus, <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne compoſitum ſubſtantiale requirit materiam &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam ſubſtantialem ex quibus componatur: Omne Corpus Naturale eſt compoſitum Subſtantiale, Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> &amp;c. In which, Syllogiſm for Brevity ſake I ſhall deny the Minor, becauſe nothing in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is compoſed of Matter and a diſtinct Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but Man.</p>
                     <p>The Second Argument they bring, is, that if Subſtantial Forms were deny'd, all Bodies muſt be <hi>Entia per Accidens;</hi> to which it may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that there is no ſuch Neceſſity, ſince Matter, Figure, Texture and Motion, <hi>ordinantur per ſe &amp; intrinſice,</hi> to make up natural Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                     <p>Another Argument which they alledge is, That if there were no Subſtantial Forms, there could be no Subſtantial Definitions; which comes to no more, than that if we don't grant ſome things which are not in Nature, we ſhall want a Foundation for our Definitions: And indeed if we muſt define Natural Bodies by Imaginary Forms, which we know not, it is better to exchange <hi>Subſtantial</hi> for <hi>Eſſential</hi> Definitions, grounded on the Eſſential Differences of Natural Bodies themſelves.</p>

                        </note>Theſe Arguments for Subſtantial Forms being examined, I ſhall briefly conſider the Phyſical Arguments uſually alledged for the proof of them.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, the Spontaneous cooling of hot Water; an Action uſually attributed to the Power of the Subſtantial Form; which might
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59609:34"/>be plauſible, were it not otherwiſe to be explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for Bodies eſteem'd cold, having their Parts in a leſs Agitation than the Natural Juices about the Senſory, cauſe that Senſation; but when the Parts of that Water, by the heat of the Fire, are put into a Violent Motion, ſtronger than that of the Parts of Matter about our Senſory, it becomes hot; which hot Water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing removed from the Fire, and the Agitation of its Parts being diminiſhed, it returns to its juſt Temperature: To effect which, a Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Form is no more requiſite, than when a Ship is put into a violent Motion in a Storm, there is required a Subſtantial Form to ſtop its Motion upon the ceaſing of that Storm. And in oppoſition to Subſtantial Forms, it may be likewiſe conſidered, that Water in upper Rooms in hot Climates, will be kept warm, and in <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> in the Form of Ice, meerly by the Temper of the Air, in ſpite of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Form.</p>
                     <p>Another Argument urged is, that Matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indifferent to all Accidents, it wants a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Form to link the Accidents requiſite to every Particular Body together. To which it is anſwered, that the World being now made and conſtituted, the Phaenomena of Nature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on one part of Matter acting on another; ſo that eſpecially fluid Bodies frequently change their States, being altered by the ſeveral Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Year, and Temperature of the Air, which is evident from the different Effects it hath on Weather-Glaſſes. So that the Accidents obſervable in moſt Bodies, depend on Agents and Efficient Cauſes, which produce in Matter
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59609:35"/>what in the Precedent Chapter we call an <hi>Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Form:</hi> And there is no need of a Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Form to keep thoſe Accidents together, ſince they will continue in the ſame ſtate, till ſome other Agent works on them, which is ſtrong enough to deſtroy and change the Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Form of that Matter; which Agent, the aſſiſtance of a Subſtantial Form being not able to reſiſt, the Body in ſpite of the Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetick Doctrin muſt be chang'd; an inſtance of which we have in Lead, which (tho' when melted, it returns to it's priſtine ſtate upon cooling) if it be long continued upon a Violent Fire, will be turned into a reddiſh brittle Glaſs, and loſe all its former Qualities; and retains thoſe new acquired ones, till ſome powerful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick Agent, cauſe a freſh Change. On the contrary, Oranges, Tamarinds, Senna, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Bodies, retain the ſame Qualities, when gathered and removed from the Soul of the Tree, and without the influence of its Form, which they had before whilſt growing: And the colour of Snow ſoon periſheth, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding its Subſtantial Form, its Texture being altered by a Diſſolution.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The <hi>Parts</hi> of a <hi>Body</hi> may adhere without the help of a <hi>Subſtantial Form.</hi>
                        </note>But there is ſtill another Argument general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alledged in favour of Subſtantial Forms; which is, that without them, the various changes obſervable in Bodies, and the adhering of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Parts of Matter united into one <hi>Totum,</hi> would be unaccountable. As to the firſt Part of this Argument, it is eaſily anſwered, ſince Local Motion variouſly determined, is able to effect conſiderable and various Changes in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; an Inſtance of which (beſides what hath
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59609:35"/>been ſaid in the firſt, and the preceding part of this Chapter) we have in Tallow, which by the Mechanical Effects of Fire, exchanges Heat for Coldneſs, Fludity for Firmneſs, and inſtead of Whiteneſs, puts on Tranſparency. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Changes which are cauſed by the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one ſingle Quality in an Agent, as Heat; the Operations of Bodies, proceeding from the Texture of the whole, are various, as appears by Factitious Vitriol, which is made of Iron and a Corroſive Menſtruum, yet hath all the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Natural Vitriol.</p>
                     <p>And as to the Second Part of the Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Parts of a Body could not be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited into one without a Suſtantial Form; I anſwer, That a Connexion of Parts convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly figured is ſufficient; as when a <hi>Pear</hi> is grafted on a <hi>White-thorn,</hi> or a <hi>Plum</hi> is inoculated on an <hi>Apricock;</hi> there is a Union of Two different Forms meerly by a Connexion of the Parts of Matter, and the Parts grafted or inoculated, receive Nouriſhment as naturally, as if they were ſuppoſed to be joined by a Subſtantial Form, to a Stock of the ſame Form and Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with themſelves. Another Inſtance of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion by a Connexion of certain figured Parts, we have in Glaſs, where the Particles of Sand are linked together with the Saline ones, by the help of Colliquation, and the violent Action of the Fire.</p>
                     <p>But to conclude; I am not ignorant that it is alledged in favour of Subſtantial Forms, that they render Natural Philoſophy much more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and that it would be very imperfect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them; which comes to no more, than that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59609:36"/>if we muſt not explain things difficult by things unknown, we muſt be imperfect; where I think the Imperfection is not at all remedied; for ſhould it be ask'd why <hi>Jet</hi> attracts <hi>Straws,</hi> or why <hi>Rhabarb</hi> is a <hi>Cholagogue,</hi> and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſhould be, by reaſon of their Subſtantial Forms; it would be all one as to ſay, by I know not what, becauſe thoſe Forms are unknown.</p>
                     <p>Being therefore in things purely appertaining to Natural Philoſophy, unwilling to believe what is not intelligible, I ſhall leave the Doctrin of Subſtantial Forms, to thoſe that have clearer Heads than my ſelf, and ſhall rather proceed upon Intelligible Principles.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, That the <hi>Technical</hi> Word <hi>Form</hi> is uſually made uſe of, to ſignify ſome conſpicuous <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi> of a Body, upon the Abolition of which it is ſaid to change, or depoſit its Form.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That thoſe Parts, or Subſtances uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally held to be the ſubject of Inheſion to a Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Form, are Organical; and tho' ſome appear as to Senſe Similar; yet are they compos'd of Parts very different: As <hi>Vitriol,</hi> which tho' to Senſe it appears to be a Similar Subſtance, yet it is by Art diſcover'd to conſiſt of Saline Parts, united with a Metalline Subſtance: And <hi>Rhubarb,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of that Specifick Form it had whilſt grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, according to their Doctrin, exerts its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate or Subſtantial Form, when laid up for uſe, retains Virtues, which are different from each other; as a <hi>Styptick</hi> Virtue, when the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative is extracted: So that there is no Reaſon but that it ſhould have Subordinate Forms, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to each of theſe Qualities, diſtinct from thoſe which are call'd <hi>Forma Miſtionis,</hi> by the Schools: But further, we may obſerve in an <hi>Almond,</hi> which tho' when gather'd, it loſes its Vegetative Form; and that which was before Subordinate becomes the Specifick Form of it: yet there is no Reaſon why we ſhould deny Forms Subordinate to that, ſince by a bare Preſſure, it diſcovers it ſelf to conſiſt of an Oyl and an Inſipid Subſtance, both of which have Forms diſtinct from that of the entire Fruit: To theſe,<note place="margin">Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to prove <hi>Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Forms.</hi>
                        </note> I ſhall add two Inſtances more; the firſt of which is in <hi>Sulphur Vive,</hi> which by being kindled under a Bell, yields oyly Parts which are ſpent in a Flame, and Saline Corpuſcle, which, being condens'd by the Moiſture of the Air, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the ſides of the Glaſs, and conſtitute a

                        </note>Thirdly, That all the Ingredients of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound by Uniting, make one Form, upon the Union of which all the Effects of that Body de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, is evident in Gun-powder, the Action of that Compound depending on the Concurring and united Effects of Charcoal, Nitre, and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur: So that</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Tho' a Compound acts by Virtue of its Compoſition, and <hi>ad modium unius;</hi> yet each of its Ingredients retain their particular Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, as well as their Modifications, which diſtinguiſh'd them from other Bodies before that Compoſition was made: and this is evident from what ſome of the <hi>Ariſtotelians</hi> write concerning the Life of an <hi>Embryo; viz.</hi> That an <hi>Embryo</hi> hath a Vegetative and Senſitive Life, before that of a Man; where the Vegetative and Senſitive Souls, pre-exiſtent to the Rational, are not deſtroy'd, but only depos'd by the Succeſſion of a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added Soul; which become the Specifick Form; from whence it Naturally follows, that there are Forms which in reſpect of others are only <hi>Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> and diſpoſe the Matter modify'd by them, to receive a more exquiſite Stamp, or a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Form; which, if it be not added, thoſe ruder
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59609:38"/>Forms, are nevertheleſs Specifick in reſpect of thoſe Bodies they are the Forms of.</p>
                     <p>But tho' I make uſe of theſe Arguments, I would not be thought to adopt altogether what theſe Men teach,<note place="margin">In what Senſe the Soul may be ſaid to be the <hi>Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Form.</hi>
                        </note> having elſewhere explain'd, in what Senſe, according to their Doctrin, the Souls of Living Bodies may be ſaid to be their Forms, by obſerving the Difference betwixt Animating and Natural Forms, as to the Manner of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the Bodies they belong to. As the Soul is not the ſole Architect of the Body, nor do the Properties of the Body flow from it, tho' in other Bodies the Compound Form, as well as Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, depend on the Forms of the Ingredients of that Body united.<note place="margin">In what the <hi>Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Forms</hi> of an <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi> Body differ from thoſe of <hi>an Inanimate.</hi>
                        </note> And indeed the Properties of a Body are ſo far from flowing from the Specifick Form, where the Soul alone is eſteem'd ſo; that in Brutes, as well as Plants, ſeveral Qualities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main undeſtroy'd, after the Form is deſtroy'd; as Shape, Colour, and Vertues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And tho' it be held by ſome, That there's a <hi>Forma Cadaveris,</hi> that keeps the Parts of a dead Body united, and preſerves their Qualities en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire; yet, ſince it is only held as neceſſary, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the <hi>Peripatetick</hi> Doctrin, we ſhall not diſpute it; but ſhall only ſay, That the Fabrick and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of the parts of a Body, are ſufficient to preſerve the Priſtine Qualities of it from Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, till the Internal Agitation of the Juices breaks that Texture: which is apparent by what hath been obſerv'd in very cold Countries, as <hi>Ruſſia</hi> and <hi>Sweden;</hi> where the dead Bodies are for ſeveral Months kept unburied, and uncorrupted: and in <hi>Aromatick</hi> Plants, there is an undeniable Argument, ſince after the Vegetative Soul is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59609:38"/>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd, they continue uncorrupted for ſeveral Years.</p>

The firſt is, That the Spring of a <hi>Watch</hi> is as truly a Spring before it is made a Part of that <hi>Watch,</hi> as after; and as truly hath its Form: And tho' <hi>Copper</hi> by Corroſive Spirits be turn'd into a <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and conſequently the Form of <hi>Copper,</hi> in reſpect of that <hi>Vitriol,</hi> becomes a Subordinate Form; yet it is as truly one as that of any other Body.</p>

                        </gap>, yet it is a Matter of Difficulty to know what Form is moſt Noble; ſince Pearls, which are of the greateſt Value, being prepar'd in the Form of a <hi>Magiſtery,</hi> are of little Value to them that only wear them; tho' by a Sick Man the latter is more to be priz'd.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, But tho' it be ſo difficult to diſtinguiſh Valuable Forms, from thoſe of leſs Eſteem; yet there may be allow'd ſome Diſtinction amongſt Subordinate Forms, in as much as ſome belong to Similar, and others to Organical Parts.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, amongſt the Parts of Plants, or Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, there may be ſome Parts ſo modify'd, as to put on the Form of Seminal Principles, which upon the Diſſolution of that Body, may act as ſuch, in actuating and guiding ſome Parts of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo, as to convene into Inſects, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        </note> foraſmuch as we may as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily attribute the Effects of a Compound Body, to the mix'd Action of the Compounded Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, as to the Subſervient Actions of Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Forms, which united will have an Action in common, and proper to their Complex Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification; it being different from what each of thoſe Ingredients would produce ſeparately. As in a Ballance, the Scale, which by its Specifick Gravity ought to tend downwards, is rais'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, by the Addition of a Weight in the other Scale. So an Arrow, by the Spring of a Bow, is forc'd to flie in a Line, different from what its Specifick Gravity would incline it to, and with greater Violence. And as a Clock, whoſe Parts
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59609:40"/>concur to the forming of an Engine, proper to produce ſuch Effects, as uſually are produc'd in that Machine, does not act by Virtue of a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendent Specifick Form; but the Parts are ſet on Motion, and move Mechanically by the help of Weights; ſo, ſeveral Subordinate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, may have a Joynt Effect, each of thoſe Bodies cooperating, and modifying each other's Actions. Likewiſe Gun-powder, acts not by Virtue of a Specifick Form, ſuperintending Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate ones, but Mechanically, by Virtue of the Joynt Effects of its Ingredients; which is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, ſince the Effects of the Compoſition are ſo different from what the ſeparate Ingredients would produce; and as from hence it appears, that the Efficacy of it depends on its Mechanick Texture; ſo, to make it appear, that the Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients were but ſlightly mix'd, I boyl'd the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it in Water, and, evaporating the filtred Liquor, obtain'd Criſtals of Salt-Petre, the black ſtuff remaining in the Filtre, being inſipid, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamable like Sulphur: And this black Matter being boyl'd in a ſtrong Lixivium, ſo as to diſſolve the Sulphur, the Sulphureous Liquor will run through a Filtre, leaving the Charcoal behind; into which Liquour if an Acid Spirit be dropp'd, the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur precipitates in the Form of a white Powder.</p>
                     <p>But to illuſtrate our Doctrin of Forms and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities a little further, I ſhall add, That a blue and yellow Powder being mix'd in a juſt Proportion, produc'd a green Colour: which did not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, becauſe thoſe two Ingredients were ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to a Predominant Form; but becauſe they both being joyn'd made a Compound Impreſſion

                     <p>So that tho' the Operations of Compounded Subſtances depend on the United Texture of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Forms,<note place="margin">Neither are the <hi>Actions</hi> of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds</hi> wholly to be attributed to their <hi>Union.</hi>

                     <p>To conclude this Diſcourſe, we ſhall again take Notice of what we have before hinted at in the beginning, <hi>viz.</hi> The unfixt uſe of the Word <hi>Form,</hi> and that a Body is ſaid to be of this or that Form, upon the Account of a very few Qualities: If then the Form be nothing but a <hi>Congeries</hi> of Accidents, it may, by proper Agents, loſe that Form, the Subordinate ones ſtill remaining un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſolv'd;<note place="margin">The Modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications <hi>of</hi> Bodies <hi>two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</hi>
                        </note> till a more powerful Agent deſtroys them too: (ſo that a Body may have a twofold Modificatiod:) As for Inſtance, The Spring of a <hi>Watch,</hi> may, by being put into the Fire, loſe that Elaſtick Virtue; yet nevertheleſs the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59609:42"/>is Iron, and retains Qualities proper to ſuch a Subſtance. Again, another Inſtance we have in a Roſe, which when it hath loſt its Faculty of receiving a Nutritious Sap from the Tree, yet it retains other Qualities, which depend on the Texture and Modification of its ſolid Parts, the former being only Qualities, in reſpect of the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick Form; but the latter, the Reſult of its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture.</p>
                     <p>To illuſtrate this Notion a little further, I ſhall make uſe of the following Compariſon, <hi>viz.</hi> That as a <hi>Mill,</hi> which is an Organical Machine, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms what belongs to it as ſuch, as long as it is ſupply'd with Water; ſo a <hi>Plant</hi> is enabl'd to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſeveral things, whilſt actuated by a Vital Spirit: And further, as a <hi>Mill</hi> upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption or Congelation of that Water, ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the ſame Parts it had before, ſo do the Parts of a <hi>Plant,</hi> tho' the Soul ceaſes its communicative Virtue. And to continue the Parallel further, as the Conſtituent Parts of a <hi>Mill</hi> are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd, tho' the Faculty of Operating as ſuch be loſt; ſo neither is the Water, but only by reaſon of Congelation, or Evaporating in the Form of Exhalations, ceaſes to coexiſt in a Form fit to turn the <hi>Mill:</hi> So tho' a <hi>Plant</hi> or <hi>Flower</hi> be lopt off, and retains the ſame Texture of its ſolid Parts, yet when it ceaſes to be water'd with a continual ſupply of Sap, the Sap is only diſpers'd in the Air, or intercepted, and ſpent in ſome other Part of the Tree: From whence it appears, that nothing at all periſhes, but only the Manner of Union, and the Particular Modification of thoſe Parts of Matter ceaſe; ſo that thoſe ſolid Parts are no longer fitly adapted to be nouriſh'd by
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59609:43"/>thoſe Fluids. Which Inſtance may ſerve to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate our Doctrin, tho' there be conſiderable Difference betwixt the things compar'd, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as a <hi>Plant</hi> hath not always that Aptitude to be again actuated as the <hi>Mill</hi> hath.</p>
                     <p>But there are ſome Inſtances, which may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Difference leſs conſiderable, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the <hi>Roſe</hi> of <hi>Jericho,</hi> which tho' for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.

As a Lime-Stone, being Phyſically chang'd by the Influence of Congruous Particles, when expos'd to the Air, will yield <hi>Salt-Petre,</hi> genuine and inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable.

                        <note place="margin">Inanimate Bodies <hi>have</hi> Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Forms.</note>V. It is agreeable to Reaſon, to admit of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Forms, in Bodies Inanimate.</p>
                     <p>Againſt this it is objected, That one Body can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have two Forms.

                     <p>A Second Objection is, That a Body having a Compleat Form, whatever is Concurrent to it, makes it <hi>Ens per Accidens.</hi> To this it may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, That according to the Schools, the Soul and Body, which have each ſeparately diſtinct Forms, being joyn'd, make <hi>

So a piece of Lead is Vitrify'd by the Action of the Fire, by which Action the Parts, which before were pliable, become brittle; and being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe rang'd as to Situation, give way to the Rays of Light, and becomes Tranſparent: And <hi>Salt-Petre,</hi> by the Addition of Coal and Sulphur, inſtead of burning by degrees, and leaving an <hi>Alkalizate</hi> Salt behind it, flaſhes all away at once.</p>

                     <p>To prove this, we are to conſider, what hath been already obſerv'd: As Firſt, That the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the Word <hi>Form,</hi> is made uſe of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarily,</hi> and without ſufficient Diſtinction.

Thirdly, That they are attributed to Bodies, upon the account of ſome particular Qualities; as Unctuouſneſs in Oyls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or ſome particular Uſe. Pourthly, Agreeably to theſe, a Body muſt be endued wich ſeveral of thoſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, upon the Account of which Bodies are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to different Claſſes. As in <hi>Vitrum Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monii,</hi> in which beſides thoſe Qualities by which it is referr'd to Glaſs, it hath a Vomitive and Purgative Faculty, by which it is brought into another Claſs in <hi>Phyſick.</hi> Fifthly, It is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, that theſe Forms ſhould depend on one another; ſince neither the Vomitive nor Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Faculty depend on the Form of Glaſs, they both being inherent in the <hi>Calx,</hi> before it was Vitrify'd, and would be preſerv'd, tho' the Glaſs, without an Addition of other Matter, ſhould be turn'd into a <hi>Regulus.</hi> Sixthly, To theſe Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59609:48"/>we may add, That the Qualities of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, are ſaid to be leſs or more Noble, in reſpect of their different Uſes: As in Glaſs of <hi>Antimony,</hi> tho' the Glaſs may be taken for the Nobleſt Form by an Artiſt, yet its other <hi>Antimonial</hi> Qualities are more Eminent amongſt <hi>Chymiſts</hi> and <hi>Phyſicians.</hi> Seventhly, From theſe Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we may gather, that the moſt Predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Form is not always that which denominates the Form of a Body; but ſometimes that which is moſt Eminent, <hi>that is,</hi> moſt regarded.</p>

                     <p>So that the Subjection of ſome ſort of Forms, ſeems very difficult to be explain'd.

                     <p>Now if from hence it appears, That the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Figures of <hi>Salts,</hi> generally alledg'd as Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of the Neceſſity of <hi>Subſtantial Forms,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend meerly upon <hi>Texture;</hi> why may not the more Ordinary <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, ſince it is manifeſt that <hi>Matter,</hi> and a <hi>Congeries</hi> of <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> are ſufficient to account for what is uſually attributed to <hi>Imaginary Forms?</hi> Neither can I ſee Reaſon, why Arguments grounded on the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and Effects of Bodies, eſteem'd factitious, may not be ſufficient to ſhew us, what may be aſcrib'd to the <hi>Mechanical Affections</hi> of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Maſs of Matter; ſince it is not agreed how fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitious ſhall be diſtinguiſh'd from that <hi>Species</hi> of Body, call'd <hi>The Productions of Nature.</hi> In fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of which <hi>Gun-Powder</hi> is no deſpicable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; where by a bare Mixture of <hi>Nitre,</hi>

                           </note>The Firſt I ſhall begin with is, what occurs in hatching of an <hi>Egg.</hi> And.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, we are to conſider, that in a Prolifick <hi>Egg,</hi> by the ſame Reaſon, that Bones and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes are called <hi>Similar Parts</hi> of an Animal; the Liquor of the Yolk, as well as the White, is to Senſe, a <hi>Similar Subſtance,</hi> though by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation ſeveral Subſtances may be drawn from them.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, That by beating the White of an <hi>Egg</hi> well, it loſes much of its Tenacity, and becomes a fluid Body; in which Agitation, there is only a Mechanical Alteration of the Texture of the Body.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, That the Rudiments of the <hi>Chick,</hi> lodged in the <hi>Cicatricula,</hi> are nouriſhed only by the <hi>White,</hi> till it becomes a great <hi>Chick;</hi> the <hi>Yolk</hi> being reſerved as a ſtronger Nouriſhment, till the <hi>White</hi> is ſpent, and the <hi>Chick</hi> is able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt it; and in effect the <hi>Chick</hi> ſeems to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with Head, Wings, Beak and Claws, before the <hi>Yolk</hi> is touched.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, It is not a little to be admired that ſo Soft and Similar a Liquor as that of an <hi>Egg,</hi> ſhould be in ſo ſhort a time, changed into a <hi>Chick,</hi> endowed with Organical Parts of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Fabricks; and Similar ones different in Texture very much from one another; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Liquors contained in the Solid Parts, being as different as the former, and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</p>

Thirdly,</hi> Occult Qualities, as when Birds or Parts of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals, afford Specifick Medicines, or at leaſt moſt Noble ones. But</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, ſince ſome may Object, that theſe Parts are formed by the Plaſtick Power of the Soul, and that a <hi>Chick</hi> is not a Mechanically contrived Engine, we are to conſider, that let the Plaſtick Principle be what it will, yet ſtill, being a Phyſical Agent, it muſt act after a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal manner; and having no other Matter to work upon, but the <hi>White</hi> of the <hi>Egg,</hi> it can work upon that Matter but as Phyſical Agents, and conſequently can but divide the Matter into Minute Parts of ſeveral Sizes and Shapes, and by local Motion ſo variouſly contex them, as is requiſite to produce an Animal of this or that Species; though from ſo many various Textures of the Parts formed, there muſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ariſe ſuch different Colours, Taſtes and Conſiſtencies, and other Qualities, as we have taken Notice of: For we are not here to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſo much, what is the Agent or Efficient in theſe Productions, but after what manner the Matter they are made of, is affected in producing them: To illuſtrate which, we may obſerve, that a Man who is to frame a Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or ſome curious Engine, though he may by the help of Reaſon and Art, skillfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive his Materials, yet he can but move, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, tranſpoſe and contex the ſeveral Parts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which he reduces the Matter aſſigned.</p>

                        <p>And that the Soul of a <hi>Hen,</hi> does not any more contribute to the forming of a <hi>Chick,</hi> is plain; fince we are aſſur'd, that multitudes of <hi>Eggs</hi> may be hatch'd meerly by the regulated Heat, either of Ovens, or Dunghills: Whence it eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, That the <hi>Plaſtick</hi> Power, no otherwiſe contributes to the Formation of a <hi>Chick,</hi> than by guiding the Parts of the White, put into Motion by the external Heat; ſo, that they may aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate after a manner neceſſary to produce an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical <hi>Chick.</hi>

                           </note>From the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of this Experiment, may be drawn ſeveral Inſtances to our Purpoſe.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. That a Light Body reduc'd into Parts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently Figur'd, may be mix'd with a Body heavier than it ſelf; ſo that <hi>Gold,</hi> the heavieſt of Bodies, may float in a Liquor, if its Parts be diſſolv'd, and render'd minute enough by <hi>Aqua Regis.</hi> From which two Obſervations we may Learn; That the Textures of Bodies, as well as the Rules of <hi>Hydroſtaticks,</hi> are concern'd in determining, whether Bodies will ſink or ſwim.</p>
                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:59609:60"/>
                        <p n="2">II. That ſeveral Colours may be produc'd, by a Mixture of a Colourleſs Liquor, and a White <hi>Concrete.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">III. That thoſe Colours may again be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd, and the former renew'd by <hi>Water,</hi> which can neither afford the Colour it reduces <hi>Camphire</hi> to, nor deſtroy that of the Liquor.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. That a Light Body emerges out of one much lighter, which did not in a heavier Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, which the Mixture was before the Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Water;</hi> which may be an Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Schools concerning <hi>Miſtion;</hi> ſince ſome of them aſſert, That, in <hi>Miſtion,</hi> the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments depoſe their own Forms, and put on new; whereas the <hi>Camphire</hi> had not its Form deſtroy'd throughout the Proceſs; but ſtill retain'd its own Qualities in a Diſpoſition to be again united.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. It is to be admir'd, That Odours ſhould depend on ſo ſlight a Texture, that <hi>Camphire,</hi> by a bare Separation of its Parts, ſhould loſe its Scent, and upon the Mixture of a Body void of Odour, ſhould again recover its Smell; and that ſo ſlight a Texture, as that of the <hi>Oyl</hi> and <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire,</hi> ſhould, as to Senſe, wholly for a time alter the Qualities of the Latter: And that ſeveral of the preceding <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> are caus'd by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Texture of the Liquors, made uſe of to exhibit them, is manifeſt, becauſe if <hi>Camphire</hi> be caſt into Spirit of <hi>Nitre,</hi> well dephlegm'd, it will not afford thoſe <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> which it does with Oyl of <hi>Vitriol.</hi> And when to the Red Mixture, above-mention'd, two or three parts of Spirit of <hi>Wine,</hi> were added inſtead of <hi>Water,</hi> no ſuch Changes ſucceeded; but the whole Mixture, with its Accidental Colour, was diſſolv'd by it, being
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59609:61"/>in Colour much like Red <hi>Turbid Wine:</hi> So that the Colour of the Mixture was wholly owing to the Mixture of the <hi>Oyl</hi> and <hi>Camphire,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on their Union; which is further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, becauſe when we added a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of <hi>Water</hi> to that Turbid Liquor, it preſently depos'd its Colour; and the Particles of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire</hi> immediately emerged in the Form of a white Powder.</p>
                        <p>But there are other <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> which by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of this <hi>Experiment,</hi> the Mixture afforded us: For,</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. Having kept the Mixture moderately warm in a Glaſs Retort, and diſtill'd it; the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor drawn off had a Smell, unlike both that of the <hi>Camphire,</hi> and alſo that of the Mixture: And the Ingredients united in this Mixture, were both. Tranſparent, in the Senſe that Fluid and Solid Bodies contus'd are ſaid to be ſo; yet the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Maſs, not only became <hi>Opacous,</hi> but of a very Black Colour: ſome Parts of it, being not unlike poliſh'd <hi>Jets;</hi> which is the more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, becauſe <hi>Camphire Chimically</hi> handled, uſually aſcends in White Flowers, leaving behind them a <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> of an Agreeable Colour.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. The laſt <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> this Mixture afforded us was, That tho' <hi>Camphire</hi> be a Body very much diſpos'd to diſſipate, and fly away; yet by the Aſſociation of the <hi>Oyl,</hi> it might be kept together, ſo that the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> above-nam'd, was able to endure a pretty hot Fire in the Retort, before it was reduc'd to that Pitchy Subſtance, lately taken Notice of: And further it was Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, That Part of the Subſtance being taken out of the Retort, and kept in a Red-hot Crucible
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59609:61"/>for half an Hour, it afforded a conſiderable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Black Brittle Matter, without the leaſt Smell of <hi>Camphire: Fixedneſs</hi> and <hi>Volatility</hi> are ſo much vary'd by <hi>Texture.</hi>

                        <p>Firſt then, Having put a Pound of <hi>Venetian</hi> Sublimate, groſly beaten, into a Glaſs Retort; we threw in Copper Plates, an Inch broad, and about as thick as a Grain of Wheat; ſo that the Aſcending Fumes, might by Compulſion act on the incumbent Metal: Which being done, we plac'd the Retort in a Sand Furnace; and having adapted a ſmall Receiver, we continu'd a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Fire, for ſeven or eight Hours; and at the laſt increas'd it to a conſiderable degree, which was as high, as the Furnace would permit: The Effects of which Operation were the following.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. Very little Liquor was carry'd over into the Receiver, but about ten Ounces of Sublimate was cruſted over the Neck of the Retort: The Retort contain'd two Ounces and a Quarter of Running Mercury; and what was to be admir'd was, the Acid Spirit, uniting with the Copper, left the Mercury unaffected.</item>
                           <pb n="82" facs="tcp:59609:62"/>
                           <item>2. When the Fire was increas'd, the Matter, beginning to Melt in the Retort, made a Noiſe not unlike to <hi>Vitriol,</hi> when brought to a Fuſion, in a Calcining Pot: which Circumſtance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly accompany'd this <hi>Experiment;</hi> whereas the ſame <hi>Experiment</hi> being again try'd, we ſcarce could find either in the Retort, or Receiver, the leaſt Running <hi>Mercury.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>3. The Lump of Metal in the Retort, was heavier by more than two Ounces; ſome of the Plates being too thick, and yet retaining their Shape and Malleableneſs; the others, being chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into a Brittle Lump, like a piece of good <hi>Benjamin,</hi> which, when broke, was of divers Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and almoſt Tranſparent.</item>
                           <item>4. But this Lump, being divided into ſmaller Pieces, and expos'd to the Air in white Paper, in a Night's Time it was Colour'd like <hi>Verdigreeſe</hi> on the out-ſide; which by its longer continuance in the Air, penetrated deeper; yet the Paper which it ſtain'd, was ting'd with a Green, inclining to Yellow. And here we may take Notice of the ſtrange Subtlety of the Air, which alter'd ſome of theſe Fragments ſo, that they were cover'd over with a Powder, like <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride aeris,</hi> notwithſtanding they were ſhut up in a cloſe Box.</item>
                           <item>5. Here I ſhall obſerve, That ſeveral Copper Plates, off which <hi>Sulphur</hi> had been drawn, had not their Shapes alter'd in the leaſt; but were colour'd over with a white Silver colour, which penetrated the whole Subſtance of them, being much more glorious within, than on the Surface of the Metal: ſo that we ſuſpected the Sublimate to be adulterated with <hi>Arſenick;</hi> but that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59609:62"/>its Malleableneſs; which <hi>Arſenick</hi> uſually takes away.</item>
                           <item>6. We thought it more conſiderable, becauſe the <hi>Venus</hi> of the Copper was ſo unlock'd, that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Tranſparent Subſtance, would melt like Roſin, and burn with a laſting Flame, if laid on a Red-burning Coal, or held to a Candle, much like the Flame of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> only more Green.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>To theſe <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> afforded by Sublimate and Copper, I ſhall joyn ſome, obſerv'd in the like <hi>Experiment,</hi> with Sublimate and Silver.</p>
                        <p>We put ten thin Silver Plates into a well-coated Retort, with double the weight of Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate upon it, which when Sublim'd, the Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate aſcended into the Neck of the Retort; in which was to be found ſeveral Portions of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd <hi>Mercury:</hi> In the bottom of the Retort was a Lump of Matter, which could ſcarce be ſeparated from the Glaſs, but was brittle and of a Pale Yellow, and much of the ſame weight with the Metal. In the middle of the Lump, were contain'd pieces of Silver very brittle, but not totally diſſolv'd: This Roſin, as that of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, when moiſten'd by the Air, was in 24 Hours cover'd over with a Greeniſh Duſt; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were the Reſult of Sublimate working on the Copper, which Silver is generally alloy'd with, or on the Compound Metal, I will not dare to determine: Yet it is uſual for <hi>Painters</hi> to make a ſine kind of Azure of Silver, by corroding it with Saline Bodies: All that I ſhall add to be obſerv'd in this our Firſt Tryal, is that this Roſin, when caſt upon hot Coals, continu'd flaming for a conſiderable Time, the Colour of the Flame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very like that of Copper.</p>
                        <pb n="84" facs="tcp:59609:63"/>
                        <p>But for a Second <hi>Experiment,</hi> we made uſe of an Ounce of Refiu'd Silver Laminated, and caſt upon double its quantity of Sublimate; which, by the violent Force of the Fire, being partly melted, we found in the Retort a Lump of Matter, which in ſome places next the Glaſs, was cover'd with a thin Plate of Silver, the remaining part of the Metal, (except ſome ſmall pieces) being diſſolv'd into a Subſtance, neither like Silver, nor any other Metal or Mineral. In which proceſs it is ſtrange, that ſo fix'd a Metal, ſhould, by an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a Fourth Part of Matter, be ſo alter'd in its Qualities; as alſo, that a Maſs of an Amber or deep <hi>Amethyſtine</hi> Colour, (ſome of whoſe Parts on he upper Superficies were of a light Yellow, which on the lower ended abruptly in a colour not far from a Black one) ſhould be the Reſult of a Mixture of two white Bodies: Nor is it leſs to be admir'd, that a Body Tranſparent like Amber, ſhould be made of ſo Opacous a Body as Silver, mix'd with a white Powder; and that Silver, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the Qualities of a Metal, ſhould become a Friable Body; and when cut with a ſharp In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, like Horn; as alſo, that it ſhould be chang'd into a Body, apt to take Flame at a Candle, which before was difficult to melt.</p>
                        <p>Theſe <hi>Experiments</hi> being try'd; To ſhew how much theſe Qualities depended on the Particular Textures of Bodies, I took two diſtinct Urinals, and put Gold finely Laminated in one, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd Gold in the other, with a treble weight of Sublimate to each; which tho' rais'd in a Sand-Furnace, alter'd neither of them: But in theſe <hi>Experiments,</hi> being forc'd to make uſe of a Sand-Furnace, I could not employ a Fire ſo ſtrong as
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59609:63"/>I could have wiſh'd for, which might in ſome meaſure alter the <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> which our <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment</hi> might have otherwiſe afforded: But,</p>
                        <p>Before I leave this <hi>Experiment,</hi> it may not be improper to give the following Advertiſement, <hi>viz.</hi> That a further Improvement might be made of this <hi>Experiment,</hi> by making uſe of ſeveral kinds of Sublimates; which might eaſily be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by raiſing ſeveral other Bodies up with Sublimate. Of which I ſhall add an Inſtance; for having Sublim'd a Mixture of equal Parts of Sal Armoniack, and Common Sublimate, in Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals plac'd in a Sand-Furnace, I obtain'd a Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate different from the former; for Salt of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar diſſolv'd, being drop'd into the Common ſort diſſolv'd in Water, turn'd it into an Orange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tawny Colour, but chang'd a Solution of the other into a Liquor white like Milk.</p>
                        <p>To try the Effects of this New Sublimate, we Sublim'd it with a Mixture of Copper in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort, in the bottom of which was to be found a Cupreous Roſin, which would, as the other above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd, turn to <hi>Verdigreeſe:</hi> But it is very Remarkable in this <hi>Experiment,</hi> That the Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate was ting'd with a Blewiſh-Green, by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Copper carry'd along with it; and alſo, that in the Receiver, was found near an Ounce of Liquor ting'd with Copper: From whence it appears, That this open'd the Texture of Copper, more Powerfully than the other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of Sublimate.</p>

                           <item>Sixthly, It is to be admir'd, that a Body in Texture, not unlike a piece of Horn, ſhould be the Reſult of an Aſſociation of two rigid Bodies: Wherefore to be ſatisfy'd, That the Alteration depended on the Texture of Parts of the Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, I made uſe of the Oyl of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Spirit of Salt, and found that the <hi>Concrete</hi> reſulting from an Union of that with the <hi>Cryſtals</hi> of Silver, differ'd from the former, it being much more brittle, and eaſily divided into Parts.</item>

                           </note> Having made a Salt of very different Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties from all others, and which is ſo nice in the Preparation, that it is as difficult to direct how it is to be made, as to make it; I ſhall rather chuſe to mention what <hi>Phaenomena</hi> it afforded me.</p>
                        <p>The Firſt Thing Obſervable was, That tho' the Ingredients of this Salt were Eminently Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, yet the Salt it ſelf was judg'd by a Stranger to be Sweet, tho' it had a Sweetneſs peculiar to it ſelf, as every Sweet Body hath: Another Thing Conſiderable is, That tho' it be of an Inoffenſive Smell, when cool; yet if expos'd to a conſiderable Heat, it emitted <hi>Effluviums</hi> more ſtrongly <hi>faetid</hi> than thoſe of <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> Spirit of <hi>Armoniack</hi> Salt, or Diſtill'd Urine; whereas thoſe Fumes being again united, into a Salt, became Inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive as before.</p>
                        <p>And it is further to be Obſerv'd, That tho' all Volatile, Fix'd, and Lixiviate Salts are ſo ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fically different from each other, that being mix'd together, they ferment, and by that means deſtroy each other, and unite into a Subſtance different from each; yet this Salt is ſo powerful, as to be deſtroy'd by none of them; but being mix'd with any of them, remains quiet, and without the leaſt Ebullition: But to be further ſatisfy'd that it was different from each of the foremention'd Salts; I try'd ſeveral Experiments, by which I ſound, that it would neither turn Syrup of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets red, as Acids do, nor green, as Volatile and Fix'd Salts uſually do; and tho' Spirit of <hi>Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack,</hi>
                           <pb n="89" facs="tcp:59609:65"/>Salt, or Urine will turn a Solution of Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate in Water, white; and Salt of Tartar will give it an Orange Colour; yet was it not in the leaſt alter'd by this: Nay, tho' this Salt was dropt into a Solution of Syrup of Violets, along with Acids and <hi>Alkalyes,</hi> yet did it not hinder their Effects: Tho' in Diſſolving ſeveral Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, this Salt exceeds both <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and Oyl of Vitriol.</p>
                        <p>And it is further Obſervable, That tho' by a gentle Heat, this Salt wholly Sublimes; yet when mix'd with Liquors, it does not fly away, as other Volatile Salts do; and tho' it be Volatile, yet it will run <hi>per Deliquium,</hi> as ſoon as any Salt can do, and as preſent reaſſumes its own Form, the Superfluous Moiſture being taken from it; add to this, That by a gentle Heat it may be diſſolv'd in a Limpid Liquor. And, it is endu'd with a Quality yet more Admirable, for it will readily diſſolve, either in Spirit of Wine, or Water, or Oyls themſelves: whereas ſome Bodies which may be diſſolv'd in Water, cannot incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate with Oyls or Spirit of Wine, and <hi>è con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versò.</hi>

                                 </note> which was effected by conſuming the more Fugitive Parth of the Salts, by repeated Deflagrations; whereupon it acquir'd, inſtead of an <hi>Acid,</hi> a Lixiviate Taſte; would turn Syrup of Violets green, precipitate a Solution of Sublimate, into an Orange Colour; and as other fix'd Salts, would ferment with even Spirit of Salt; which <hi>Alkalyzate</hi> Nature, could not be ſuppos'd to proceed from the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal Aſhes; becauſe the whole Quantity made uſe of, could not yield above 2 or 3 Grains of Salt: Yet that I might be further ſatisfy'd, I drop'd a ſufficient Quantity of <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> upon the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiviate Salt, till the Mixture ceas'd to ferment; which upon Coagulation, ſhot into <hi>Saline Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals,</hi> from the Inflammable Qualities of which

As for the other Qualities of it, it was eaſily fuſible by Heat, yet was not inflammable like <hi>Nitre,</hi> tho' quick Coals were thrown upon it in a Crucible; for it was ſo far from that, that when it was hot enough to kindle <hi>Sulphur,</hi> it neither flaſh'd nor flam'd it ſelf, as <hi>Salt-Petre</hi> uſually does; yet this white Subſtance, being kept in Fuſion for a while, with a little piece of Charcoal in it, ſmell'd very

                        <p>Encourag'd by theſe Circumſtances, (they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing agreeable to what <hi>Glauber</hi> relates of his Salt) and ſince he made uſe of Veſſels of Silver, I judg'd it could not be <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> that he open'd the <hi>Sea-Salt</hi> with; nor common Spirit of <hi>Salt,</hi> becauſe too weak; wherefore having put an equal weight of Oyl of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and <hi>Sea-Salt</hi> together, into a Glaſs Cucurbite ſet in Sand, I obtain'd, beſides Phlegm, a Spirit of <hi>Salt;</hi> which mix'd with Spirit of <hi>Nitre,</hi> diſſolv'd Crude <hi>Gold;</hi> and likewiſe when pour'd upon Spirit of Urine, and fermented, till there no longer ſucceeded an Ebullition, after a gentle Evaporation, it ſhot into <hi>Cryſtals,</hi> like Combs and Feathers; from whence it appear'd to be of a like Nature to <hi>Sal Armoniack.</hi> The <hi>Experiment</hi> ſometimes alſo ſucceeded, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Oyl of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> I made uſe of Oyl of <hi>Sulphur</hi> by the Bell.</p>
                        <p>But to apply this <hi>Experiment</hi> to our preſent Purpoſe; we may obſerve, That tho' <hi>Sea-Salt</hi> be ſo fixt, as not to be rais'd without a conſiderable quantity of beaten Bricks, to prevent its Fuſion, and a naked Fire; yet when its Parts are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock'd by an Addition of Oyl of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> they may be carry'd over with a Moderate Fire in Sand, the <hi>Vitriol</hi> being fix'd and left behind; yet in other reſpects conſiderably chang'd, ſo as to be void both of the Taſte of <hi>Sea-Salt</hi> and <hi>Vitriol.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And from this <hi>Experiment,</hi> what I formerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated, likewiſe appears; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Figures of <hi>Salts,</hi> by being embody'd with other Subſtances, might be ſo far chang'd, as to ſhoot into <hi>Cryſtals</hi>

                        <p>But to conclude this <hi>Experiment,</hi> I have found this Preparation of <hi>Sal Mirabilis</hi> very uncertain and tireſome, by reaſon of the Diſparities of Bodies taken to be Oyl of <hi>Vitriol.</hi>

                        <p>The Gold being a ſecond time reduced to a Body, by a repeated Solution in the aforeſaid <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> yeilded more of that Powder, which reduced to a Body was White, and being diſſolved in <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> had the ſame nauſeous bitter Taſte with Silver; ſo that it is plain the Tranſmutation of Metals is not impoſſible, nor Gold a Metal impoſſible to be deſtroy'd; ſo that I am more apt to believe, that by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Menſtruums</hi> the Body of Gold may be ſo ordered, as to communicate a Tincture to a Liquor duly conjoyned;<note place="margin">The Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmution of Metals not impoſſible.</note> as when Sulphur and Mercury by a Coalition conſtitute <hi>Vermilion;</hi> ſince from this Inſtance it is plain, that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the Tincture (as well as of the <hi>Vermilion</hi>) may be produced by the Poſition and Texture of ſome Particles of Gold aſſociated with that Liquor.</p>
                        <p>And that the Colour of ſuch Tinctures as well as of the Gold it ſelf depend on certain Particles conveniently Modified, I rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, becauſe I am told, that a known Man in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> had a certain <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> which would extract a blue Tincture from the Calx of Copper, prepared by a Diſſolution in <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> leaving a white Powder behind, which would by Fuſion be turn'd into a Metal of the ſame Colour.</p>
                        <p>A ſecond Inference which may be drawn from the foregoing <hi>Experiment,</hi> is, that if Gold, one of the moſt Permanent Bodies, may have it's Texture deſtroyed, there is no Body in Nature but may undergo a Change, when wrought on by an appropriated Agent; and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59609:68"/>that the nobleſt of Metals may be Mechanical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tranſmuted; from whence it appears alſo, that the nobleſt of Forms, are but the Reſults of the Texture of the Parts of Matter of which they conſiſt; and a Convention of Accidents, which are the Subſtratum of that Texture: So that without a ſubſtantial Form, merely by a ſaline <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> the Body of Gold may be changed into another ſubſtance, of very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Qualities from what it had before.</p>
                        <p>But to render our preſent <hi>Experiment</hi> more inſtructive; I ſhall add another Attempt, to ſublime Gold after the following Method. Having then diſſolved laminated Gold in ſome of the above mentioned <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> we drew it off in a Retort placed in a Sand-Furnace, by which means a conſiderable Quantity of Gold was elevated, and either fell into the Receiver in the Form of a Golden coloured Liquor, or ſhot into red Cryſtals like Rubies in the Neck of the Retort; which in the Air would run <hi>per Deliquium:</hi> Where we are to obſerve, that by a new Affuſion of the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> upon the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Calx, more of itwould ſtill be elevated by Diſtillation.</p>
                        <p>But to make this <hi>Experiment</hi> more ſerviceable, it will be neceſſary to Note, that upon pouring running Mercury into this elevated Tincture, the Particles of it were immediately Guilded, and by degrees, the Mercury being kept in Motion, the whole Liquor loſt it's Tincture, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing decanted, and the Guilded Mercury with a good Quantity of <hi>Borax</hi> Melted in a Crucible, the elevated Gold was reduced into a Maſs;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59609:69"/>which evinces what I juſt now taught, <hi>viz.</hi> that a Liquor might be Tinctured by having the Parts of that Body, from whence it received it's Tincture, conveniently interwoven in it's Texture, without being wholly deſtroyed.</p>
                        <p>And here I think it ſeaſonable to advertiſe, that having elſewhere mentioned a Volatile Gold in ſome Oars, where none of that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal is to be found; I would be underſtood to mean it Volatile in no other Senſe, than the foregoing Sublimation intimates, <hi>viz.</hi> that it's Volatility depends on a mixture of Volatile Parts which carry it along with them, when diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into very minute Parts; ſo as to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Swimming in that Vehicle.</p>

                              <item>3. After it had lain a conſiderable time in a Red-hot Crucible, it was neither diminiſh'd in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, nor did it in the leaſt ſmoke.</item>

                        <p>But to leave theſe Reflections, I ſhall mention ſome Scruples, concerning this Tranſmuted <hi>Powder,</hi> which I could not have time to ſatisfy my ſelf in: As, Whether the Water Remaining was lighter than before Diſtillation? Whether the Particles of Inſipid Bodies, may act as <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruums</hi> in the Diſſolution of others? not but that they may be ſo chang'd in the Veſſels of Plants, as to become ſharp and powerfully pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59609:71"/>Whether the Weight of the Glaſs-Veſſel, was diminiſh'd by this <hi>Experiment?</hi> I ſhould likewiſe be willing to be ſatisfy'd, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Water it ſelf be truly a Homogeneous Body? which if it be, it will be ſtrange, that without the help of a <hi>Plaſtick Power,</hi> or Seminal Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, it ſhould be ſo tranſmuted; ſince that a bare Convention of the Particles of a Fluid into a Concrete ſhould alter their Specifick Gravity, is hard (if not impoſſible) to be parallell'd by <hi>Art.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But in this <hi>Experiment</hi> it is further Remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, That Oyl of <hi>Vitriol</hi> pour'd upon this Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, would corrode it, and that by an Effuſion of Spirit of Salt there was rais'd a conſiderable Ferment; as when Spirit of Salt is put upon <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis Stellaris:</hi> So that I ſuſpected the Rain-water might be impregnated with ſome of the Sandy Parts of Glaſs diſſolv'd, by the help of the Fire, and actuating the Particles of it; but this Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was partly taken off, becauſe I had obſerv'd the like Ebullition, upon a Mixture of Spirit of Salt with Wood-aſhes, which were clear'd of their Salts in Boyling Water.</p>
                        <p>But to conclude this <hi>Experiment,</hi> we may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reflect upon the fore-going Suſpitions; that if the Body of the Glaſs-Veſſel were in the leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd in this Operation, it will be a powerful Inſtance of the Force of Inſipid <hi>Menſtruums;</hi> and it will be no leſs a Confirmation of the Doctrin of <hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Qualities</hi> before deliver'd, that <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> it ſelf is ſubject to undergo ſuch conſiderable Changes, as this <hi>Experiment</hi> ſhews it is.</p>

                        <p>The <hi>Phaenomena</hi> exhibited by this <hi>Experiment</hi> were the following: Firſt, That the Spirit, firſt drawn from theſe two Inodorous Bodies, was endow'd with a Smell different from all others, and parts tho' pleaſant and fragrant, yet very ſubtle and penetrating.

Sixthly, Neither would it be mix'd for ſome Days with Water, tho' the Oyl and Spirit, readily diffuſe themſelves in that Liquor; beſides, it was of ſo very fix'd a Nature that it would not be rais'd by a ſtrong and laſting Fire, tho' both Oyl and <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and Spirit of Wine be extreamly Volatile.

                     <p>But leſt the <hi>Sal-Petre</hi> re-produc'd by the Coali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe two Bodies, ſhould be thought to lodge in the Fix'd <hi>Nitre;</hi> and only to be unyok'd by their Solution, it is requiſite to annex, That the greateſt Quantity that can be ſuppos'd to remain in the Fix'd <hi>Nitre,</hi> would not amount to ſuch a Quantity as that Mixture affords: And to make the Matter leſs ſuſpicious, we impregnated a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Pot-Aſhes, after the ſame manner as we had done the Fix'd <hi>Nitre,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Salt-Petre <hi>obtain'd from</hi> Pot-Aſhes, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua fortis, <hi>and</hi> Salt <hi>of</hi> Tartar.</note> which after Filtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Evaparation, ſhot into <hi>Cryſtals,</hi> which 0103 0207 V 3 were very like <hi>Salt-Petre</hi> in Taſte, as well as their Deflagration upon Live-coals. We likewiſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a ſmall Quantity of <hi>Salt-Petre,</hi> from <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> and <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Tartar</hi> aſſociated.</p>
                     <p>But to draw Inferences from the Foregoing <hi>Experiment;</hi> from hence we may learn, That the Senſible Qualities of Bodies may be accounted for by the <hi>Mechanical</hi> Motion, together with the Figure and Diſpoſition, or Modification of their Parts.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, tho' <hi>Salt-Petre</hi> be a Body inwardly, and in it ſelf cooling; yet the Parts of it diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently Modify'd, in our <hi>Experiment,</hi> being put
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59609:75"/>together, do immediately put each other into ſo violent a Heat, that I could with much ado hold the Glaſs in my Hand; ſo that Heat ſeems to be nothing but a quick Motion of the fineſt Particles of Bodies, ſince it no longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd in that Mixture, than the Parts of it were in Agitation.</p>
                     <p>Upon the Mixture of theſe two, <hi>viz.</hi> the Spirit of <hi>Nitre,</hi> with the Fix'd, there was likewiſe produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced an audible Sound, proceeding from the Percuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Air, by the ſwiftly and impetuouſly agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated Parts of the Mixture: A Sound like to which is produc'd by a hot Coal caſt into Water, or into melted <hi>Nitre</hi> in a Crucible, tho' the Latter cauſes a Sound much louder. Which Sound probably proceeded from the Percuſſion of the Air, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Motion of a Bullet, or a Stick, where the Quickneſs of the Percuſſion puts the Air into an Undulating Motion, will cauſe a Sound, as ſoon as that Undulating Motion reaches the Ear; and it is further confirm'd, becauſe that Sound no longer continues, than the Parts are violently agitated: And here it is to be obſerv'd, That the Sound, produc'd by the Mutual Conflict, ceaſes long before the Heat, which is acquir'd by that Ebullition; from whence it may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd, that the ſame Inteſtine Motion of Parts which are able to produce Heat, are incapable of cauſing Sounds; as <hi>Amber</hi> continues warm a conſiderable time after the Sound, made in rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of it, ceaſeth.</p>

                        <pb n="110" facs="tcp:59609:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>of <hi>Tartar;</hi> it is ſurpizing, that theſe two ſhould unite into a Body of ſo much leſs pungency in Taſte as Nitre, bateing that it is a little ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per by reaſon of ſome Spirituous Parts ſticking to the Particles of the Nitre.</p>
                     <p>But beſides theſe there are ſeveral other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections may be made on the preceding <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> for it ſeems a Queſtion, whether there is any real neceſſity of a diſtinct Sulphur to render a Body Inflammable, or whether rather Inflammability depends on a diſpoſition of Matter to be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Motion by the help of adventitious Bodies; as when the Ingredients of our <hi>Experiment</hi> are mixed; or when a Piece of Iron is caſt into Spirit of Nitre; for the Parts of that Liquor, which before were quiet and cold, meeting with Pores which diſorder their Motion, they preſently begin to move among one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a ſtrange Rapidity, and to cauſe ſuch a Heat, that the Veſſel would burn the Hands of them that held it: And here it may not be amiſs to take notice of one thing further, that Occurs in our <hi>Experiment, viz.</hi> that tho' Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre put upon a burning Coal, or a burning Coal being caſt into it, will conſume it ſelf, in a Blue Flame, yet when it is contiguous to the <hi>Sides</hi> of the <hi>Crucible</hi> which is red Hot, it melts without the leaſt Flame. It may be alſo worth Enquiry, why Nitre which is a ſolid Body ſhould not rather ſtick in the Form of Sublimate to the Receiver, like <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſe only into a Liquor, which does not again coagulate as ſome Volatile Spirits do.</p>
                     <p>But leaving theſe <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> I ſhall obſerve further, that though Spirit of Nitre, expoſed to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59609:76"/>the Air Inſenſibly exhales, yet when aſſociated with it's own fixed Salt, it admits no ſuch Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viums. Another thing to be obſerved is, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Mixture of theſe two Liquors, ſeveral <hi>Saline</hi> Parts are toſſed out of the Glaſs into the Air, which falling down again, ſeveral Grains of Salt will remain on the outſide of the Vial, which will be viſible if the <hi>Experiment</hi> be tried in the Sun Beams. And that there is a very brisk Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongſt the Parts of Spirit of Nitre, is evident by dropping ſome of it into a ſolution of Salt of <hi>Tartar;</hi> for immediately ſome Grains were ſhattered in Pieces, and thrown up to the top with a ſeeming Violence; till the ſtrength of thoſe Liquors was mutually diminiſhed by their frequent Occurſions: And that the Parts of each have contrary tendencies in their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is plain, from this, <hi>viz.</hi> if when the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ceaſes, more of one of theſe Liquors was dropped in, there followed no Ebullition, till ſome of the other was added to Ferment with it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The ſame Particles of Matter have diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Effects when in a Fluid, from what they have in a ſolid Form.</note>And here it is ſeaſonable to obſerve what different Effects the Parts of theſe Bodies have when at liberty and disjoyned in Liquids, from what they produce when locked up in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes, tho' their Effects, even then, are not wholly to be attributed to the briskneſs of their Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but alſo, to their determinate Sizes; by which means <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> which leaves Gold untouched, will diſſolve Silver; yet, by an Addition of <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> it having acquired a new Figure, and a peculiar Motion, it Works upon Gold; and for the like Reaſons a Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fixed Nitre will diſſolve <hi>

                     <p>Again we may obſerve, that the ſeveral ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances into which <hi>Salt-Petre</hi> is reduced, <hi>viz.</hi> the fixed Salt and the Volatile Liquor, are both different from the Concrete it ſelf; which is an Argument againſt thoſe <hi>Chymiſts</hi> that pretend, that Bodies Diſtilled, retain the Virtues of thoſe Bodies they are Diſtilled from;<note place="margin">Chymiſtry rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys than diſcovers the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note> for the Acid Spirit of Nitre will precipitate the ſame Bodies, which fixed Nitre diſſolves. And ſo Spirit of Nitre will turn a <hi>Tincture</hi> of <hi>Braſil</hi> into a Yellow Colour, which it will loſe, and in ſome Meaſure by an addition of a <hi>Tincture</hi> of fixed Nitre, regain the former, whereas a Solution of <hi>Salt-Petre</hi> changes neither of theſe <hi>Tinctures.</hi> Eut to proceed,</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Experiment</hi> gives us Reaſon to believe, that the Air is conſiderably concerned in the Production of <hi>Salt-Petre,</hi> and in giving a Figure to it's Salts; ſince the Cryſtals, which ſhoot in the Solution expoſed to the open Air, are of a more exact <hi>Size</hi> and <hi>Figure,</hi> than thoſe obtained after a quicker Evaporation. Beſides which we have obſerved, that a Mixture of <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> and Salt of <hi>Tartar</hi> yielded Cryſtals much more like Nitre, when it had been expoſed to the the Air for ſome time, than what it afforded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an immediate Cryſtallization.</p>
                     <p>As for the Reaſon why the Cryſtals which ſhoot in the Air, are more naturally Figured than others; I conceive it to be, becauſe the Air is a more quiet and undiſturbed Vehicle for them to move leaſurely in, by which means they have the Liberty of uniting as they ought, to form Cryſtals of a natural Figure, which Gueſs
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59609:77"/>is confirmed, becauſe the Cryſtals which ſhot in Water, where they have room enough, and an indifferent Vehicle, were more perfect than thoſe, which were produced by a Mixture of the nitrous Powder and <hi>Saline</hi> Spirit, where they were forced, for want of Room, to Cry ſtalize, before they had time to Convene after a manner requiſite to make them of a natural <hi>Figure</hi> and <hi>Size.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to proceed: This <hi>Experiment,</hi> which ſhews how a Body divided into different ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, by Diſtillation, may be again united into an Original Concrete, will be a very ſtrong and convincing Inſtance to prove, that the <hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Qualities</hi> of Bodies depend on an eſſential Modification of their Parts; and that the difference obſervable in particular Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, depends on a different <hi>Texture,</hi> and a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alition of Parts of different <hi>Figures</hi> and <hi>Sizes;</hi> ſo that the <hi>Redintegration</hi> of Bodies is no more, but a reſtoring of their former Parts into the ſame Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Poſition, being Artificially handled, ſo as to acquire their former <hi>Sizes</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> in order to their Coalition.</p>
                     <p>Yet this I think neceſſary to be repreſented, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Compoſition of <hi>Nitre</hi> is ſo little Organical, that it will be hard to judge what ſucceſs, in order to <hi>Redintegration,</hi> may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in other Bodies, where the <hi>Fabricks</hi> of them are ſo curious, by Reaſon of their numerous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, and the curious Contexture of them, that the latter is not to be imitated by Art, in the Production of Subſtances much leſs Organi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cal, than the Parts of living Animals.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Chymical Medicines laid aſide too raſhly.</note>The laſt Obſervation I ſhall make on our <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,</hi> is, That from what hath been ſaid it
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59609:78"/>may be thought that ſome Chymical Medicines may be too Raſhly laid aſide by ſome Phyſitians, who ſuppoſe, that the <hi>Menſtruums</hi> made uſe of in their Preparations, are in ſome meaſure mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them; ſince, beſides that thoſe Salts may by care be waſhed away, ſeveral Parts of them may be ſo altered by Corroſion, that thoſe, aſſociating with other Particles of the Body they work upon, may degenerate into an innocent Concrete: An Inſtance of which we have in our <hi>Experiment,</hi> where a corroſive Spirit and a Cauſtick fixed Salt, unite into an innocent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine. And that Corroſive Salts may in a great meaſure be dulcified by their acting on other ſubſtances, is evident in a Mixture of Spirit of <hi>Vitriol</hi> and <hi>Crabs Eyes,</hi> or any other teſtaceous Body. And again, though Vinegar power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully corrodes calcined Lead, yet uniting with it, it conſtitutes a Sweet Body, in which the ſharpneſs of Vinegar is perfectly deſtroyed. And tho' it be an Argument uſually alledged againſt the uſe of Medicines ſo prepared, that from ſeveral of them corroſive Particles may be drawn; yet ſince the ſame may be Effected by the Action of Fire upon <hi>Salt-Petre,</hi> the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is as invalid as the general Practice of Phyſitians can make it.</p>

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59609:80"/>Parts of <hi>Wine,</hi> in ſome Countries, will freeze; yet the Spirituous Corpuſcles of the ſame Liquor remain untouch'd: And tho' it is evident, by the help of good Weather-Glaſſes, that Cold condenſes the Air; yet it was never ſo far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed, as to become Ice; becauſe the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Motion concurring with the Minuteneſs and Shape of its Parts, they are always in an Agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion requiſite to keep it in that Form; and it is not improbable, but that the Parts of <hi>Salt</hi> are very Minute; ſince, from <hi>Experiments</hi> before mention'd, it appears, That Spirit of <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> will unite into a <hi>Sal-Armoniack;</hi> and it is further confirm'd, ſince, <hi>Common-Salt,</hi> mix'd with <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> will diſſolve <hi>Gold,</hi> as well as Spirit of <hi>Salt</hi> joyn'd with the Latter: and tho' Crude <hi>Nitre</hi> it ſelf, be mix'd with Spirit of <hi>Salt,</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting Mixture will ſupply the Place of an <hi>Aqua Regis.</hi> And I am inform'd that, that a <hi>Chymist</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> drew no leſs than fourteen Ounces of Spirit from a Pound of <hi>Salt,</hi> a whitiſh Clay being made uſe of inſtead of the Common <hi>Caput Mortuum;</hi> and that when he had dephlegm'd the Spirit, twelve Ounces remain'd very highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify'd; which may be ſomething in favour of <hi>Beguinus,</hi> who pretends to have got a Pound of Spirit from a pound of <hi>Salt.</hi> But it may be a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, Whether the <hi>Fluidity</hi> of theſe Bodies may not in part proceed from the Action of the Fire, working upon ſome Parts of the <hi>Concrete;</hi> ſince a Phlegm or Water may be obtain'd from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify'd Spirit, ſo as to change Part of it into a moiſt Body like Water.

                        </note> without the help of that Noble <hi>Alkahest,</hi> which would render Groſs Bodies wholly Liquid.</p>
                     <p>And here it is requiſite to add, That it is not only the Sizes of the Parts of Bodies, that endues them with a Diſpoſition to <hi>Fluidity,</hi> but alſo, their Shapes; and I am the more confirm'd in this Opinion, becauſe, having diſtill'd <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Olives</hi> in a Glaſs-Retort, <hi>per ſe,</hi> near a third Part of it was coagulated in the Receiver, into a whitiſh Subſtance, not very much unlike Butter; where the diſtill'd Subſtance, which uſually is fluid, tho' drawn from ſolid <hi>Concretes,</hi> was on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in this <hi>Experiment,</hi> a Conſiſtent one, yielded by a Liquid; for which no other Reaſon can be given, but that the Shape of the Liquid Parts were ſo alter'd, as to become unfit for Motion.</p>
                     <p>But to return to the Reaſon of <hi>Fluidity,</hi> it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, That in pouring of Sand, Corn, Flower, Apples, Walnuts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> out of a Sack, that that Aggregate of Bodies, whoſe Parts are the leaſt, appears moſt like Liquids; and it is commonly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, That Whites of Eggs, by being beaten with a Whisk, preſently loſe their Clammineſs and Viſcidity, and are reduc'd to a thin and fluid Subſtance, their Parts being broke aſunder, and more minutely divided. And I have obſerv'd, that That Jelly (which is by the Vulgar thought to fall from a Star) by being a long time digeſted in a well-ſtopp'd Glaſs, became a permanent Liquor.</p>
                     <p>Again, it is obſerv'd, That when <hi>Silver</hi> is to be caſt in Moulds, and to receive the Curious and Fine Impreſſions of Hair-Lines, the Metal is not only to be pour'd in very hot, but to be kept a Conſiderable Time in Fuſion, before it is thin
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59609:81"/>enough to run into thoſe Lines, and to take exact Impreſſions of them; from whence it appears, That Bodies already fluid, may become more fluid; and the like Inſtances might be brought from other Bodies, as <hi>Turpentine, Oyl, &amp;c.</hi> And if what <hi>Helinont</hi> aſſerts of the Liquor <hi>Alkahest,</hi> be true, <hi>viz.</hi> That it will turn all Subſtances, whether <hi>Minerals, Metals, Plants,</hi> or <hi>Animals,</hi> into a fluid Subſtance, of an equal Weight with each other; then it follows, That to divide a Body into Parts ſmall enough, is enough to make it fluid. And to this I muſt add, that conſiderable Changes may be effected, meerly by a long Digeſtion in Veſſels well ſtopp'd, and plac'd in a Convenient Heat.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Second Requiſite to conſtitute a Fluid Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, is, That it ſhould have conſiderable Vacuities or Pores, betwixt the Parts of it;<note place="margin">

                        </note> for if there were no ſuch Spaces, the Parts being put into Motion, would not have Space to continue it in, nor could one Particle by the Impulſe of another, be forc'd to give way. But before I proceed, it will be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite here to Note, That by <hi>Spaces,</hi> I would not be thought to mean <hi>Vacuities</hi> properly ſo call'd; but that there is no ſuch Subſtance betwixt them, which will obſtruct the Motions of the more Solid Parts.</p>
                     <p>This Caution being premis'd, I ſhall (to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate this Second Requiſite) obſerve, That <hi>Snow,</hi> which is of an open and ſlight Texture, before it is compreſs'd, may ſoon be ſqueez'd into ſo cloſe and compact a Lump, as to reſiſt a very ſtrong Preſſure; the <hi>Air,</hi> which before was interpos'd betwixt the Parts of it, being preſs'd out.

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59609:81"/>confin'd together, reſiſt Impreſſions like a Solid Body; and this <hi>Experiment</hi> I the rather made uſe of, than a Bladder diſtended with <hi>Air,</hi> becauſe the Diſtention of that, might partly be attributed to the Spring of the Included <hi>Air.</hi>

                        </note>But it is further to be obſerv'd, That tho' ſuch <hi>Vacuities</hi> are neceſſary to conſtitute Fluid Bodies, yet they are only ſo, to uſe <hi>School</hi>-Term, as <hi>Removens, prohibens, i. e.</hi> they prevent the Inconveniencies which muſt be the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of a Plentitude, <hi>viz.</hi> Want of Liberty to move; or in other Words, as they diſpoſe the Parts of a Body, to yield to each other's Motion. And here I would Note, That tho' in moſt Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid Bodies, this Doctrin may take place; yet I conceive it not altogether abſurd, to Queſtion, Whether <hi>Matter</hi> may not be ſo exquiſitely agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated and divided, as to fill up theſe <hi>Vacuities,</hi> and to be ſqueez'd into any Figure, as Occaſion requires.

To the Principal and laſt Requiſite, in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying a Fluid Body; which is, That all the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of a Fluid Body, ſhould be ſeparately and variouſly mov'd up and down, either by Virtue of ſome ſubtle Matter diffus'd through their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or an inherent Quality of their own. For the Difference betwixt Solid and Fluid Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, ſeems to conſiſt in this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Parts of Solids are at reſt, and not ſo apt to yield to the Preſſure of One's Finger, as the Parts of Liquids are, which are in Motion; ſince the Latter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already agitated to and fro, it is much more eaſy to guide that Motion, than to put the Parts of a Body into Motion; whoſe Parts, according
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59609:82"/>to the Laws of Motion, muſt be at reſt, till mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v'd by an Agent powerful enough to put them into Motion.</p>
                     <p>But when once they are put into Motion, by the ſame Laws, they muſt continue ſo, till ſtopp'd by ſome other Body; and conſequently, they muſt be in a perpetual Change, as to their Places and Order: ſo that hence it appears, why ſome Bodies come to be ſo ſoft, ſince ſuch ſmall Parts of Matter, being in Perpetual Motion, muſt needs yield very eaſily to the Touch, and give way to the Impreſſions of other Bodies. And alſo, it cannot but diſpoſe them eaſily to be confin'd by the Veſſels they are contain'd in, and as apt to diſperſe themſelves, when Liberty is given them.</p>
                     <p>Having premis'd this Brief Account of <hi>Fluidity,</hi> I ſhall now proceed to illuſtrate it by <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi> And firſt, by that concerning <hi>Salt-Petre.</hi>

                        <hi>Salt-Petre</hi> then may become a Fluid Body, either by having the Particles of it diſſolv'd in Water, ſo that they may move up and down, and to give way to the Impreſſion of an External Agent, as the other Parts of that Liquid do; or it may put on a Liquid Form, by being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the Air in a moiſt Cellar, where by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>per Deliquium,</hi> the <hi>Salt-Petre</hi> will be diſſolv'd, and put on ſo far the Form of a Liquid, as to have all it's Parts in an Agitation, ſufficient to rank it amongſt Fluid Bodies.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Salt-Petre</hi> may put on a Liquid Form, without the Addition of a Liquid Body; as firſt, It may be reduc'd to ſo fine a Powder, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble a Liquid, in the pouring of it out of one Veſſel into another, beſides the other Requiſites
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59609:82"/>of a Fluid Body; <hi>viz.</hi> That it hath Vacuities betwixt its Parts, and that they may be eaſily put into Motion; only they differ from the Parts of Liquids in ſome Reſpects, ſince the Powder hath not it's Parts always in Motion; beſides the Vacuities are more ſenſible: But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, if by the force of Fire each of theſe Parts be again ſubdivided, thoſe inſenſible Corpuſcles, being violently agitated, make up a Fluid Body: So the Particles of Metals, being by the ſame Agent ſeperated and put into Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, do not only move variouſly one amongſt another, but are ſometimes toſs'd a conſiderable height into the Air. And not only Fire, but ſome other Bodies, which are ſenſibly Cold, may, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Texture and Motion of their Parts be rightly diſpos'd, reduce ſeveral Subſtances to a Liquid Form; ſo <hi>Camphire</hi> puts on the Form of an Oyl, when ſwimming upon <hi>Aqua fortis:</hi> And when <hi>Salt-Petre</hi> is by the Action of Fire, endow'd with a Fluid Form, it is equally a Fluid, as when incorporated with Water, there being very little difference betwixt theſe two States of <hi>Nitre;</hi> only that in the Former, the Agent, which keeps the <hi>Nitrous</hi> Parts in Motion, is more Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and Brisk, and divides it into ſmaller Parts, without making an Addition to its Bulk.</p>
                     <p>But, perhaps, it will be a Scruple, Whether the Powder of <hi>Nitre</hi> be an Imperfect Fluid, when pour'd out, or rather like a heap of Sand, not reduc'd to a permanent State of Fluidity: To remove this Scruple, we may take Powder of <hi>Alablaſter,</hi> or inſtead of it, Plaſter of <hi>Paris,</hi> and we ſhall find, that by putting it into a hot Veſſel, by the continued Action of the Fire, the Parts of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59609:83"/>that Powder will be ſo agitated, and, by the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the more Spirituous Parts, kept in Motion, as to Boil and emit Steams like a Fluid Body, and altogether reſemble a Coherent Subſtance; yet, if it be remov'd from the Fire, it again ſubſides in the Form of a Powder, tho' for once again it will aſſume the Form of a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid, if expos'd to a competent degree of Fire; yet when the Ebullition of the Parts of it are moſt violent, if a ſmall Portion of it be thrown upon a piece of Paper, it appears to be nothing but a very fine Powder: From whence it is evident, that Fluidity depends on a vehement and various Agitation of Parts; which Fluidity the ſame Body may be depriv'd of, by loſing that Inteſtine Motion.</p>

                        <note place="margin">What the <hi>Motion</hi> of the Parts of <hi>Fluids</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on.</note>And thus it briefly appears how much Motion contributes to the Fluidity of Bodies. And here, tho' it would be very deſirable to determine what is the Eſſential Cauſe of that Motion; yet ſince it is a Matter of too much Intricacy, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by ſome held to be inherent in Matter, and by others to be promoted by Impulſe, I ſhall ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſs it by, than enter upon an Examination of thoſe two Points; eſpecially, ſince there would be the ſame Neceſſity of Diſcuſſing others, which equally relate to the <hi>Carteſian</hi> Principles: It may therefore ſuffice in ſhort, that neglecting the Unintelligible Doctrin of <hi>Subſtantial Forms,</hi> we rather aſcribe it to thoſe <hi>Catholick</hi> Affections of <hi>Matter, Motion, Shape,</hi> and <hi>Situation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to omit what we have elſewhere deliver'd concerning theſe <hi>Catholick</hi> Affections of Matter, we ſhall obſerve, what this <hi>Experiment</hi> further affords us: We are therefore to take Notice, That there
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59609:83"/>is a difference remarkable betwixt a Fluid, and a Body which hath a Quality of Wetting Bodies which are Contiguous to them; ſince every wet Body is Fluid, but not <hi>vice versâ:</hi> For Air, Flame, Melted Liquors, or <hi>Salt-Petre,</hi> tho' fluid, are all void of a Wetting Quality.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Humidity <hi>a</hi> Relative Quality.</note>Whence we are led to conſider, That <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity</hi> is but a Relative Quality, depending on the Congruity that one Body hath to ſtick to the Pores of another; whence ſome Fluid Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, whoſe Parts are not adapted, ſo as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the Pores of other Bodies want that Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as <hi>Quick-ſilver,</hi> which ſlips over the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces of moſt Bodies, without ſticking to them; tho' in Reſpect of ſome (as <hi>Gold</hi> or <hi>Tin,</hi>) it may be eſteem'd Fluid; ſince, inaſmuch as it diſſolves them, it hath much the ſame Virtue as Liquids have in ſoftening other Subſtances: And that Humidity depends on an apt Configuration of the Parts of Matter, and their Congruity with the Pores of other Bodies, is further evident, ſince Water it ſelf, in reſpect of ſome Bodies, is not moiſt as the Feathers of <hi>Swans, Ducks, &amp;c.</hi> Add to this, That it is further obſervable, that when the Texture of a Liquor is chang'd, it may adhere to Bodies it would not ſtick to before: As for Inſtance, Tho' neither <hi>Quick-ſilver, Lead, Tin,</hi> or <hi>Tin-glaſs,</hi> will ſtick to <hi>Glaſs;</hi> yet a due Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of each mix'd together will preſently, without the Aſſiſtance of Fire, adhere to it.<note place="margin">That the <hi>Pores</hi> of a Body can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd no Argument of their <hi>Non-exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>But further: If it be objected, That the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible Agitation of the Parts of Fluid Bodies, are but Imaginary and Precarious; ſince the Smallneſs of them, makes them too fine to appear: I muſt anſwer, That ſince their Vacuities, are
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59609:84"/>ſo ſmall as not to be Viſible, it is as impoſſible to diſcern their Parts, and conſequently the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them; ſince one Part is ſo preſently ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by another, that the Eye hath always a whole heap before it, tho' ſeparated by Pores ſo ſmall as to be undiſcerned. And tho' the. Vacuities betwixt the Parts of powdered <hi>Nitre,</hi> be ſo large, as to be diſcern'd by the Eye; yet when it's Corpuſcles, by the Action of the Fire, are render'd more Minute, not only <hi>Salt-Petre,</hi> but <hi>Gold</hi> alſo, are ſaid to poſſeſs a leſs Space, and conſequently muſt leave leſs Vacuities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt their Parts, and which are altogether In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible to the Eye: For which reaſon the Body appears continuous.</p>

And that the Air hath it's Parts in a conſtant Motion, variouſly agitated,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59609:84"/>we have ä great deal of Reaſon to believe; ſince we may eaſily diſcern whole ſwarms of <hi>Motes</hi> ſwim up and down in the <hi>Sun</hi>-Beams: and not only ſo, but in clear <hi>Sun</hi>-Shine Days, we may perceive on the Walls of Churches, and other Spacious Buildings, certain obſcure Shades to quiver and tremble: And we have yet a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inſtance in <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Tartar,</hi> which, after Fuſion, being for a conſiderable time left in a moiſt Cellar, will diſſolve, and put on the Form of a Clear Liquor, by imbibing the Moiſtneſs of the Circumambient Air, which penetrates, and gets into the Pores of the <hi>Salt</hi> by an Inteſtin and Powerful Motion. And it is further to be Noted, That if in Summer, cold Water be put into a Glaſs, the moiſt Vapours which move about it, will be condens'd on the outward ſide of the Glaſs, and appear in the Form of <hi>Dew,</hi> thoſe Moiſt Particles, which ſwim in the Air, being, by the Perpetual Motion of it's Parts, ſucceſſively driven upon the External Superficies of it: In trying of which <hi>Experiment</hi> it is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, That the <hi>Dew</hi> on the out-ſide, was not to be obſerv'd above the Surface of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor contain'd in it. And theſe Relations are the leſs to be wonder'd at, if we conſider, that ſo weighty a Body as <hi>Lead,</hi> may be rais'd in the Form of Smoke, a conſiderable height into the <hi>Air,</hi> by the Aſſiſtance of proper Veſſels, plac'd in a convenient Furnace; which Smoke, will be ſoon ſcatter'd and diſpers'd, by the Various Motion of <hi>Aerial</hi> Particles: And this <hi>Experiment</hi> does not only ſhew, that the Parts of <hi>Air</hi> are in a Perpetual Motion, but alſo how much the Minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneſs of them contributes to their <hi>Fluidity.</hi>

                     <p>But to make it almoſt Viſible, that the Parts of <hi>Liquid Bodies,</hi> are perpetually in a variouſly determin'd Motion, mix a Solution of unrefin'd <hi>Silver</hi> in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> with 15 times its Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Fair Water, Decanting or Filtrating the clear Mixture: In which Liquor the Parts of the <hi>Silver</hi> are not in the leaſt diſcern'd, tho' upon Immerging a Copper-Plate into it, the Particles of that Metal, which before ſwam up and down in the Mixture, preſently adhere to the Copper, and cruſt it over with a Metalline Powder; and if the Copper Plates remain in that Liquor for a Night, the whole ſcatter'd Corpuſcles of <hi>Silver</hi> will be collected together about them, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor being Tinctured with a Blue Tincture, by ſome Parts of the Copper, corroded and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Parts, by the Salt Parts of the <hi>Aqua fortis.</hi> And to render this <hi>Experiment</hi> ſtill more Uſeful, I have obſerv'd, That by letting a piece of <hi>Spiltre</hi> lye in this Tincture for ſome Days, the Copper Particles were gather'd round about that alſo, from all the Parts of the Liquor; which could not be, were not the Water in a Perpetual Inteſtin Motion; ſo that its Parts might, by often changing their Places, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively

                     <p>To this <hi>Experiment</hi> may be added another, which I have long ſince try'd, when firſt I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to conſider the Reaſon of <hi>Fluidity.</hi> I drop'd then, into Spirit of <hi>Wine,</hi> moderately Deflegm'd, a ſmall quantity of Oyl of <hi>Turpentine,</hi> letting it fall ſo far, that it might by the force of it be broke into ſmall Drops, which by reaſon of their Tenacity, being unapt to mix with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, would ſwim upon it, and be mov'd up and down, variouſly and irregularly, by the Spirituous Parts of the Liquor, which ſtruck againſt them in their Aſcenſion; and whilſt theſe Spirituous Parts continue to exhale, it is pleaſant to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, how the Globous Parts of the Oyl will ſometimes be gather'd together, and almoſt unite, and preſently after, be again diſpers'd abroad, and move to and fro amongſt one another; and this Motion would continue, till the moſt Agile and Spirituous Parts of the Liquor were wholly ſpent. And leſt this Motion of the Oyly Parts, ſhould be ſuſpected to ariſe from ſome <hi>Antipathy</hi> betwixt it and the Liquor, I try'd the <hi>Experiment</hi> with ſmall chop'd Straws, which were likewiſe impetuouſly, and confuſedly mov'd up and down on the Superficies of the Spirit: From whence we may learn, That there may be an Inteſtin Motion of the Parts of a Liquid Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, tho' it be not diſcern'd by the Eye. I might here reckon up a great many more <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> exhibited by this <hi>Experiment;</hi> but it ſhall ſuffice to take Notice, beſides what hath been already deliverd, That ſome of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Spirit, being clos'd up in a Glaſs,

                     <p>And that the ſmall Parts of the moſt weighty Liquors, are actually in a Continual Motion, may not only appear from what hath gone before, but may be further confirm'd; ſince <hi>Quick-ſilver</hi> will not only penetrate into the Pores, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Texture of ſo ſolid a Metal as Foliated <hi>Gold:</hi> And <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Tartar,</hi> tho' cold, is able to extract Tinctures from ſeveral Bodies: And that the Parts of Oyl of <hi>Vitriol</hi> are in a Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Motion, may be evinc'd, by the Corroſive Qualities of it, which it powerfully exerts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Aſſiſtance of Heat, not only in Corroding Metals; but if pieces of <hi>Camphire</hi> be thrown into it, they are preſently turn'd into an Oyly Subſtance. And whoever is unwilling to believe that there is an Inteſtin Motion of Parts in theſe two Oyls, may eaſily be undeceiv'd, by the Heat and Ebullition, which follows upon the Mixture of them agitated together in a Glaſs.</p>
                     <p>But here we are to obſerve, that tho' it be an Eſſential Property of <hi>Fluid Bodies,</hi> that one Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle readily gives way to another; and that the other is as apt to ſucceed in the Place of it inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably; yet that is not to be conceiv'd of all <hi>Fluid Bodies</hi> in General; but is to be underſtood only in ſuch Bodies, as are either Simple and Homogeneous, or as have an Aptitude to mix with each other, as Wine and Water; ſince there are ſome Liquid Bodies, which will not be mix'd together; but like compact Subſtances,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59609:88"/>reſiſt the Impreſſions of each others <hi>Superficies;</hi> and it is not a little ſtrange that <hi>Lucretius</hi> and ſome other of the Antient <hi>Atomiſts</hi> ſhould over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look ſo obvious an Obſervation, ſince it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent in Oyl, which will not mix with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but more eminently in <hi>Quickſilver,</hi> which denys to mix any of thoſe Liquors which were familiar amongſt them.</p>
                     <p>But to add an <hi>Experiment</hi> which is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, having ſo prepared and opened the Body of <hi>Copper</hi> with a ſufficient <hi>Quantity</hi> of <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> as to render the prepared <hi>Mineral</hi> inflammable; I applied ſome Grains of it to the Wiek of a <hi>Candle,</hi> by the force of whoſe Flames it was not only Melted, but carried up along with the <hi>Tallow</hi> to the Bottom of the Flame; where it was obſervable, that the Flame of it was both laſting, and as diſtinct from that of the <hi>Candle,</hi> as if the two Flames had been ſeparated by the Interpoſition of ſome other Body.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Why ſome Liquids are unapt to mix with each other.</note>But to return to what I have ſaid of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aptneſs of Liquors to mix with one another, the reaſon in general ſeems to be no other than the particular <hi>Texture</hi> and peculiar <hi>Motion</hi> of their Parts. And this I am the rather induced to believe, becauſe <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Tartar,</hi> diſſolved by the moiſtneſs of the Air into a <hi>Liquid Form,</hi> will readily mix with <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine,</hi> the <hi>Texture</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only changed by an addition of Water; tho' before, they both had their diſtinct <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies;</hi> and tho' mixed by a Violent Motion, yet would preſently ſeparate again, and each regain it's former Poſition.

                        <pb n="142" facs="tcp:59609:89"/>Melted or well <hi>Decrepitated,</hi> will readily mix with <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine,</hi> though there was no ſenſible difference betwixt that Oyl and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which would not.

More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, tho' cold <hi>Quickſilver</hi> will not mix with Oyl of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> yet, the boiling Oyl will, by piercing it's Subſtance, both alter and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate with it.</p>

As for Inſtance, if <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine</hi> be poured upon Oyl of <hi>Tartar per deliquium,</hi> tho' the contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Superficies</hi> of both be parallel to the <hi>Horizon,</hi> yet the upper <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Spirit will be endewed with a viſible Concavity, if the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment</hi> be tryed in a ſlender Glaſs unſtopped. In which Liquors it may be further noted, that upon a Mixture of Oyl of <hi>Almonds,</hi> it preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeparated the one from the other, the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the Oyl of <hi>Almonds</hi> contiguous to the Oyl of <hi>Tartar,</hi> being Level as well as that, which was next to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine:</hi> But if Oyl of <hi>Turpentine</hi> be poured upon it inſtead of Oyl of <hi>Almonds</hi> it will be divided into ſeveral Portions, ſome of which Swimming in the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of <hi>Wine,</hi> will be of a Globular <hi>Figure,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which riſe to the top of the Liquor, will be partly Level with the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59609:89"/>Liquor, and partly <hi>Sphaerical,</hi> on the immerſed <hi>Superficies.</hi> And it may be yet further obſerved, that ſome Globular Parts would, tho' the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor was ſhaken, continually Swim upon the Oyl of <hi>Tartar,</hi> being contiguous to it only in a Point. But what is more Remarkable is, that ſeveral drops of Oyl of <hi>Turpentine</hi> falling into the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine,</hi> lay upon the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Oyl of <hi>Tartar,</hi> like ſo many Hemiſpheres, their convex <hi>Superficies</hi> being upwards; yet by degrees they became <hi>Globular,</hi> being equally preſſed on every ſide, and touching the Oyl of <hi>Tartar</hi> only in a Point.

                           <item>II.

                           <item>III.

                           <item>VI. It was not unpleaſant to behold, how if a large Quantity of Oyl was poured into the Spirit, the Convex <hi>Superficies</hi> of it would acquire various <hi>Figures</hi> upon the Motion of that Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient

                     <p>ALTHO' the Compactneſs and Solidity of Bodies, is uſually attributed to the Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating Qualities of a ſaline Ingredient, by the Chymiſts, yet ſince their Explications are
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59609:97"/>not intelligible, I ſhall proceed to enquire after another Cauſe. <hi>Firſt</hi> then</p>
                     <p>The Solidity of a Body being a Quality con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Fluidity,<note place="margin">A Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Solidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
                        </note> ſeems to conſiſt in this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the groſs Parts of ſolid Bodies are ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled and interwoven together, that they are unapt to diffuſe themſelves ſeveral ways, like flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id Bodies; and that the Figure of their Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies is rather to be attributed to the Connection of the Parts that compoſe them, than to the Impreſſions of outward Bodies. In which De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition theſe three Things appear to be the Cauſes of Solidity, <hi>viz. Groſſneſs of Parts, Reſt,</hi> and the <hi>Implication of the conſtituent Parts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Groſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Parts of a <hi>Body</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes to its Solidity.</note>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> That <hi>the Groſſneſs of the Parts of a Body contributes to the Solidity of it,</hi> is evident from what hath been already ſaid of Fluidity; for if Minuteneſs of Parts is requiſite to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch a Quality as Fluidity, it muſt follow that the Inaptitude that is in groſſer Matter to be put in Motion muſt be a further Argument, That the Groſſneſs of Particles is conducive to <hi>Firmneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But here it is to be noted, that by Groſſneſs or Minuteneſs of Parts, I would not pretend to decide the Controverſy, Whether Bodies may be indefinitely divided into ſmaller Parts; but I would only intimate, that tho' mentally all Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies may have an indefinite Diviſibility, yet the Parts of ſolid Bodies are made up of a Number of ſuch minute Parts, as convening together form thoſe groſſer Corpuſcles, which, when united, are not to be diſſolved by the external Impreſſions of ambient Air or <hi>Aether,</hi> or any
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59609:97"/>thing elſe, uſually reckon'd amongſt the Cauſes of <hi>Fluidity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is to be noted, That tho' I have ſaid, that the Groſſneſs of Bodies contributes to their <hi>Firmneſs,</hi> yet I would be underſtood to mean, <hi>caeteris paribus;</hi> for the groſs Parts of a Body, by being broke and divided into ſmaller, may be ſo diſpos'd, to lye nearer one another, ſo as upon their more cloſe Union, to put on the Nature of <hi>Firmneſs</hi> more conſpicuouſly, by affording a more full Contact to other Bodies, eſpecially, if thoſe minuter Parts be ſo adapted, as to leave ſmaller Pores betwixt them. But this being evident from what hath gone before, I ſhall paſs on to</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Reſt</hi> contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to the Solidity of <hi>Bodies.</hi>
                        </note>The other Requiſite for the producing of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Bodies, <hi>viz. Rest,</hi> which, tho' it is taken notice of by the Ingenious <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> yet ſince it is not confirm'd by Experimental Philoſophy, I ſhall here illuſtrate it a little further; firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, that it is agreed on to be one of the Laws of Motion, That when a Body is at reſt it will continue to be ſo, till forc'd to move by the Impulſe of an outward Agent; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be urg'd by ſome Atomiſts, concerning the Adheſion of the minute Parts of Matter, yet, that a Juxta-poſition of Parts is ſufficient, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Addition of a Cement, is evident; ſince ſeveral Pieces of Glaſs, if exactly fitted and poliſhed, will adhere ſo firmly together, that by lifting up the uppermoſt the reſt will adhere ſo cloſely as to be rais'd with them; which will alſo ſucceed, if two Marbles exactly poliſhed and ground, have their Superficies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to one another; and it is further remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59609:98"/>that if two Glaſſes be rubb'd one againſt another, the one will be ſuſpended at the other, without any viſible Prop to ſupport it, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it from falling. But here it may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to take notice, that an exact and level Superficies is not always requiſite to make the Experiment ſucceed, ſince a concave and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex Glaſs rightly adapted will adhere with the ſame degree of Coheſion; an Example of which we have had in a Glaſs Stopple, duly adapted to the neck of a Bottle; by which the Bottle, containing a Pound weight of Liquor, might ſeveral times be lifted up from the Table; which could proceed from nothing, but the cloſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact of thoſe two Bodies; unleſs it be urg'd, that by preſſing the Stopple down the ſmall Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perities of the one might be ſqueez'd into the ſmall Pores of the other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">A <hi>Juxta-poſition</hi> of Parts, not the only Cauſe of their <hi>Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
                        </note>But tho' from hence it may be argu'd, that a bare Juxta-poſition is ſufficient to account for the Coheſion of the Parts of ſome Bodies, yet it is not to be deny'd, but that their ſtrict Contact may be promoted by the Spring and Preſſure of the <hi>Atmo-ſphere;</hi> ſince by reaſon of their Juxta-poſition, the Air, which preſſes upon the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Superficies, hath not an equal Preſſure to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance it on the other Side of the ſame Piece; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immediately contiguous to the lower Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Piece adjoyn'd to it; by which Means the Preſſure of the Air reſiſting the Gravity of the Glaſs, inſtead of tending towards the Centre it is boy'd up and preſs'd againſt the upper Piece, juſt as if a Board were preſs'd with ones Hand againſt the Cieling of a Room, which will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in that Place as long as the Preſſure with
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:59609:98"/>ones hand is continu'd: And indeed, That the Air does ſo preſs upon the lower Superficies of Glaſs is but the natural Effect of the Weight and Spring of it, which being bent and preſs'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, by the Weight of incumbent Air, will naturally recoyl and fly back, from the Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Earth, upon any Body which is in the Way to be preſs'd upon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Weight and Spring of the <hi>Air</hi> may contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the <hi>Coheſion</hi> of Parts.</note>To confirm this Conjecture I ſhall add, that if a Piece of Glaſs be ſtuck to the Superficies of a Looking-glaſs parallel to the Horizon, it will ſtick faſt to it, except it be mov'd by one Hand; but if the Horizontal Superficies be inclin'd, the ſmaller Glaſs will readily ſlip from one Side of the greater to the other, accordingly as it is differently inclin'd. The Reaſon of which is, partly becauſe the Gravity of it does not reſiſt the Horizontal Motion, but only that which tends from the Centre; and partly, or chiefly, becauſe the Preſſure of the Air on both Edges of the Glaſs is equal, and conſequently its own Gravity makes it tend either this or that way, as the Glaſs is variouſly erected or inclin'd; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Superficies adhering to the Looking-glaſs receives no Preſſure proportionable to the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Air recoyling againſt the lower Surface. And for a like reaſon, if the neck of a glaſs Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol full of Mercury be immers'd in fluid Quick-ſilver, the Bottle will continue near full, as long as the neck of the Glaſs is immers'd in the Quick-ſilver, tho' it be ſeveral ways inclin'd; the Reaſon of which ſeems to be, only the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the external Air upon the Surface of the Mercury; by which Means it is forc'd up againſt the Surface of the inverted Glaſs, ſo
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59609:99"/>that for want of an equivalent Preſſure upon the Mercury in the Glaſs it is kept from ſubſiding; for that it does not proceed from Nature's Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrency of a <hi>Vacuum</hi> is plain, from what hath been try'd concerning the ſuſpended Mercury in the <hi>Torrecellian</hi> Experiment; and that it may appear more fully, that the Excluſion of Air, as well as its immediate Contact, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to the keeping of Bodies from falling aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, it will ſuffice to relate, that having ſuck'd a good Quantity of Air out of a Bottle, and apply'd a Book which was next at hand to the Orifice, it ſtuck ſo firmly to it, that, tho' the Weight of it was 20 Ounces, it would be rais'd a conſiderable Height, and tho' but a ſmall Part of its Superficies adher'd to the circular Edges of the Glaſs. The Reaſon of which ſeems to be no other, than that the Preſſure of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Air overpowers the weak Reſiſtence made by the Air in the Bottle; and ſince the Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of the internal Air is ſo weak, the whole Orifice of the Bottle ſeems in ſome Meaſure to be a common Superficies; for as much as the Preſſure of the Air in the Bottle, ſcarce makes any ſenſible Impulſe upon that Part of the Book encircled by the Edges of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Solidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Glaſs</hi> depends on a <hi>Juxta-po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi> of Paris.</note>And it is not altogether improbable, but that the compact Texture of Glaſs, may depend on a like Juxta-poſition of Parts, ſince the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Fire, in the making of it, may ſo divide the Parts of the Ingredients as to render them ſubtile enough for ſo ſtrict and cloſe a Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as is requiſite to exclude Air from betwixt them; for it is not only obvious, That Air cannot penetrate the Pores of it, when heated
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:59609:99"/>in Diſtillation, but in blowing of Glaſſes where it hath not the leaſt Vent; through the Pores of it, tho' impell'd with Force, yet its Pores are fine enough to give way to the Beams of Light and Heat, and likewiſe to the fine Effluvia of a Loadſtone, without damaging the Texture of it in the leaſt; nor would it be more abſurd to conceive that the Parts of Salt-petre or Ice were after the like manner joyn'd together, by a Juxta-poſition.</p>
                     <p>But to return to the Place from whence we have made this ſhort Digreſſion; tho' from hence it appears, that the Spring of the Air may contribute to the Coheſion of the Parts of Solids; yet it is not altogether neceſſary, ſince the ſame may be accounted for by the Air con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd barely as a Weight; for the Air being a fluid Body, and preſſing by its Gravity towards the Centre, it muſt needs diffuſe it ſelf every way, when reſiſted by the Surface of the Earth, and conſequently expand it ſelf orbicularly, by which means the whole Pillar of Air incumbent on it, being virtually incumbent on the lower Superficies of the Glaſs, whatever ſeparates one from the other, muſt out-balance that Preſſure of the Air; otherwiſe (there being no Air betwixt the two Glaſſes) they muſt needs ſtick together; but it is not neceſſary that the contiguous Superficies of theſe two Glaſſes ſhould be equal to the Horizon, ſince if they be perpendicular, the Sides of the Glaſſes have a collateral Preſſure from the Pillars of Air preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing againſt them, and conſequently the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty muſt be as great to ſeparate them.</p>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:59609:100"/>
                     <p>But to try more exactly, How much the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Air is concern'd in the former Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, we took two poliſh'd Marbles, as ſmooth as we could get, and faſtned Wires to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt, ſo that the loweſt could not ſlide off the other Horizontally, but, if any way, muſt fall Perpendicularly; which Caution being obſerv'd, we found, the one would not only draw up the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but a Pair of Scales fixed to it with 16 Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Troy</hi> Weight; and to make the Experiment more compleat we found, That when the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces of the Stones were wet with pure Spirit of Wine, the Air being by that Means kept from inſinuating it ſelf betwixt the Stones, the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt would not only draw up the other with a pair of Scales, but an hundred, and ſometimes a hundred and thirty Ounces of <hi>Troy</hi> Weight; tho' the Diameter of the Stones exceeded not an Inch and two Thirds: But having repeated the Experiment with Oyl of ſweet Almonds inſtead of Spirit of Wine, we found, that it took up above four hundred Ounces <hi>Troy</hi> Weight: And that it may not be ſuſpected, That this Difference proceeds from the more clammy Parts of the Oyl, which caus'd the Stones to adhere more cloſely, I ſhall add, That the contiguous Surfaces being held perpendicular, tho' they would eaſily ſlide off each other, when moiſten'd with Oyl, yet would they not ſlip down, when moiſtned with Spirit of Wine, without an additional Weight joyn'd to one of them, the Protuberances of one, perhaps, being faſtned in the Pores of the other.</p>
                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:59609:100"/>
                     <p>But to ſhew, That the Adheſion of theſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd Marbles is proportionably greater as the Diameter of them is larger, and conſequently as they are preſs'd together by a larger Pillar of Air, I repeated the ſame Experiment with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine, and took up about four hundred and ſeventy Ounces; but when I made uſe of Oyl of Almonds, the Weight rais'd, was much more conſiderable, being a Thouſand three hundred and forty four Ounces of <hi>Troy</hi> Weight; beſides at the ſame time the Marbles were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to ſtick cloſe together: And here again, leſt it ſhould be ſuſpected, that the Oyl made the Adheſion more cloſe, I ſhall relate this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, <hi>viz.</hi> That tho' it requir'd ſo great a Weight to ſeparate theſe Stones when their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous Surfaces were in an Horizontal Line; yet would they eaſily ſlide one upon another, not unlike the contiguous Glaſſes before mention'd; and for the ſame Reaſons; and if they were the leaſt inclin'd either this way or that, their own Weight was ſufficient to ſeparate them: From whence it appears how much the Air may be concern'd in compreſſing the Particles of ſolid Bodies together.</p>
                     <p>And leſt it ſhould be further objected, That the Coheſion of theſe Stones rather proceeds from Nature's Abhorrency of a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> than the Cauſe aſſign'd by us, I ſhall add theſe Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations; <hi>Firſt,</hi> That if it were ſo, the ſame Reaſon would hold when a much more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Weight is faſtned to the lower Marble; yet we ſee, that then, notwithſtanding Nature's Abhorrency of a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> they preſently part. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Preſſure of the Air is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59609:101"/>to account for it: Which to make it more plauſible I ſhall add, that tho' the Stone were faſtned to the Ground, yet it would require as much Force, to ſeparate the Uppermoſt from it in a Perpendicular Line, as to lift up a weight aequiponderant with the Stone, and the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of Air incumbent on it, ſince there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Air, nor any other Body, betwixt the two Stones to help to raiſe the Lower up, and in part to ſuſtain the weight of the incumbent <hi>Atmoſphaere;</hi> and therefore it needs not ſeem ſtrange, that when the lower Marble and the weight affixed to it, is not ſufficient to ballance the weight of the <hi>Atmoſphaere,</hi> it ſhould riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with the Uppermoſt when drawn up, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than be ſeparated from it; ſince it is uſual, for two Bodies, when joyned together, to move the ſame way, if they be not ſeparated by Weights or ſome other Force; which is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable in trying of <hi>Load-ſtones;</hi> for if the <hi>Load-ſtone</hi> be able to raiſe a Body more ponderous than it ſelf, the Knife will as ſoon raiſe the <hi>Load-ſtone</hi> as the <hi>Load-ſtone</hi> will lift up the Knife.</p>
                     <p>To Illuſtrate what hath been ſaid I ſhall add an <hi>Experiment</hi> regiſtred amongſt my <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaria,</hi> which is this, <hi>viz.</hi> Having immerged a Glaſs <hi>Syphon</hi> with a Braſs Valve cemented on one end, almoſt half a Yard in a tall Cucur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite, till it touched the Bottom, I filled it with Water, till the Superficies of the Water in it, was equal to that in the Cucurbite, which being done, I took a pair of Scales, putting an Ounce weight into one Scale, and fixing a String to the other, one end of the String being likewiſe faſtned to the Valve, fixed to the bottom of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59609:101"/>the Glaſs Tube; where it was to be obſerved, that by that ſingle Ounce I was able to open the Valve, whereas when the Water was poured out of the Pipe, and it was immerſed again, the Valve would not be open'd again without the Additional weight of four Ounces; And in this <hi>Experiment</hi> it was further to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that as the Valve was raiſed higher and higher in the Cucurbite, a weight portionably leſs was ſufficient to open it. In which <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment,</hi> if <hi>fuga Vacui</hi> reſiſted the opening of the Valve, it would have required the ſame weight at the top of the Water as in the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, the Valve being in both places under Water. And therefore the difference rather proceeds from the Compreſſure of the Ambient Water, that preſſes the Parts of the Valve to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And tho' Air be a Body much more light than Water, yet conſidering that the difference is but about as much as 1000 to 1, and that the Particles of Air, which preſs upon our <hi>Atmoſphaere,</hi> are incumbent upon each other for ſeveral ſcore Miles in height; it is not abſurd to expect, that their preſſure ſhould be conſiderable, and ſufficient to preſs the two Marbles together.</p>
                     <p>For a further Confirmation of our Doctrine of Firmneſs, to this I ſhall add another <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which is, that having ſuſpended the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd coherent Marbles in a large Glaſs, when the Air was conſiderably exhauſted the lower preſently fell from it; And tho' the uppermoſt was let down to it, yet it could not be raiſed, till freſh Air was admitted into the Glaſs again, and then they were again preſſed
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59609:102"/>ſtrongly together and became coherent as in the open Air.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Reſt</hi> it ſelf for the moſt part ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to cauſe <hi>Reſt.</hi>
                        </note>But to return to our Diſcourſe from which theſe <hi>Experiments</hi> have made a Digreſſion; tho' the Preſſure of the Air may ſo joyn Bodies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as to make them coherent; yet gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, Reſt it ſelf is ſufficient to render a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance Solid; for ſince from what we have ſaid above, concerning <hi>Fluidity,</hi> it appears, that it depends on the Motion of Minute Parts one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt another; to deprive Matter of that Motion is enough to render it Solid, the Parts of a Solid being contiguous and at reſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſome <hi>Antients</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns</hi> brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuted.</note>I know it is by all <hi>Philoſphers,</hi> whether Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern or Antient, uſually held, that there is ſomething elſe requiſite to keep the Parts of a ſtable Body together: For ſome hold, that a Subſtantial Form is requiſite; but ſince it is equally as difficult to conceive, how Matter ſhould be ſo variouſly united in ſeveral Subſtances, by a ſubſtantial Form as without it, we may as well fly to imaginary Subſtances which are united by their peculiar Texture.</p>
                     <p>Others think, that the Particles of ſolid Bodies are linked together by a Spirit dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed throughout the World, or by a certain ſort of Glue, which Glews their ſmall Corpuſcles together. But as to the firſt its altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely; for it may as well be a Queſtion how thoſe Parts ſtick to the Spirit, as how they ſtick to one another themſelves; and it will be no leſs difficult to conceive, how the Particles of that Spirit it ſelf come to be faſtned together. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, were that true, it would follow, that Ice, which is looked upon as a Body void of Spirit,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59609:102"/>muſt abound with it; ſince the Parts of that brittle Subſtance, could not be joyned by a Spirit which was not betwixt them: Nor is it more Reaſonable to ſuppoſe them joyned by a Cement, ſince it might likewiſe be asked, how the Parts of that Cement were linked together, which ſhould it be affirmed to be done by a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance yet finer, the Queſtion might ſtill be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued <hi>ad Infinitum;</hi> ſo that, it would at laſt be allowed, that ſome Parts of Matter muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here without a Cement, or there muſt be Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments finer one than another <hi>ad Infinitum;</hi> which ſince it cannot be allowed, we may as well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that the Parts of a Body adhere without a groſs Cement, as that the Parts of a ſubtile Cement can ſtick together without another Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to Cement them; eſpecially, ſince the Corpuſcles of a Body may be ſo figured and contrived as to be linked amongſt one another very firmly; an agreeable Contact, with a real reſt of Parts, contributing to render the united ſubſtances a Solid Body.</p>
                     <p>But in favour of the former Opinion, it is urged by ſome, that the Spirit which they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe joyns the Parts of a Body together, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of Parts indiviſible; and conſequently, there is no need of another ſubſtance to Unite them: But ſince Bodies as Solid and Adamantine as theſe can be ſuppoſed to be may be broke, a bare Affirmation muſt not be taken for Proof; for to ſuppoſe, that theſe Parts of Matter were made up of hooked Parts; it would be as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to believe, that thoſe hooked Parts might not be broke, as that by a violent Agent the Particles of the moſt Solid Bodies cannot be divided, ſince it is plain they may.</p>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:59609:103"/>
                     <p>But to proceed, The laſt thing we ſuppos'd neceſſary to conſtitute a Body, was the Texture of its Parts; and indeed tho' a <hi>Juxta-poſition</hi> and <hi>Reſt</hi> of the Parts of a Body, are ſufficient to render it Solid; yet if thoſe Parts are more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately interwoven with one another, ſo as to be linked together like Hooks, it muſt contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to render the Body much more firm, Parts ſo joyned, being much more difficultly ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and put into Motion, than thoſe which have only an immediate Contact; And it may not a little ſerve to confirm our Opinion, to take Notice, that in an Egg or Water, by a meer alteration of Texture, the Diſpoſition of Corpuſcles of thoſe Subſtances are conſiderably changed; as when an Egg is, by the inſinuation of the Parts of Fire, ſo altered, as to become hard; or as when the Latter as well as Water is beaten into a Froth, which in ſome Meaſure is like a Solid Body, as long as they continue in that Form.</p>
                     <p>Having thus far inquired into the conjunct Cauſes of Solidity, we ſhall conſider briefly, how many Ways a Body may come to be ſo Modified, and what things are requiſite to make Bodies apt to put on ſuch a Form.</p>

                     <p>And indeed the correſpondent Figures of Bodies may be ſo numerous, that the ſame Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, which before in two diſtinct Bodies were Liquid, may, by an Union, have their Parts ſo interwoven with one another, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Solid; an Inſtance of which hath been given in the foregoing <hi>Chapter</hi> concerning <hi>Salt-Petre,</hi> where by a Mixture of a Liquor diſtilled from <hi>Nitre,</hi> with a Mixture of fixed Nitre run <hi>per Deliquium,</hi> a third Subſtance will be obtain'd firm and brittle, <hi>viz.</hi> a Saline Body. To this I ſhall add another, mentioned with a different deſign by <hi>Lully</hi> and <hi>Hartman,</hi> which is the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>viz.</hi> If two Parts of rectifyed Spirit of Wine; be mixed with one of Spirit of Urine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely Dephlegmed, they will in a Minute unite into a conſiſtent Body; but in this <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
                        <pb n="172" facs="tcp:59609:104"/>it is to be Noted, that the Spirits muſt be more rectified than thoſe uſually made uſe of by the generality of <hi>Chymiſts;</hi> and I ſhall further obſerve, that having my ſelf had the Curioſity to try it, I found that Spirit of <hi>Harts-horn</hi> well rectifyed would have the ſame Effects, if made uſe of inſtead of Spirit of fermented <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine.</hi> And it may be fit yet further to obſerve that tho' there was ſuch a prediſpoſition in the Parts of fermented <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine</hi> to Coagulate with Spirit of <hi>Wine,</hi> yet the higheſt Spirit of unfermented <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a different <hi>Texture</hi> would not Coagulate as the former. And it is further to be noted, that if this white Coagulum was kept in a Glaſs well ſtopped for ſome Months, by the means of Heat it would be Melted into a limpid Liquor; thoſe Parts of the Liquor which were intangled one within another being broke and diſſolved, ſo that the Particles of the united Liquors being again reſtored to ſuch Figures as would enable them to move upon one another's Surfaces, the <hi>Coagulum</hi> aſſumed the Form of a <hi>Fluid</hi> Body.</p>
                     <p>To this I ſhall ſubjoyn two <hi>Experiments</hi> which ſeem to have an Affinity with the former; the firſt is, That rectified Spirit of Wine, by being digeſted with <hi>Saccharum Saturni</hi> prepared with Spirit of Vinegar, ſo far changed its conſiſtency as to remain in a Glaſs without floating as a Liquid when the Glaſs was inclin'd; the Second is, That by the Addition of a dry Body, from whence nothing could be obtain'd by the help of the Fire, to the Coagulum juſt now mention'd, the reſult of this Mixture was a permanent Liquor.</p>
                     <p>But for as much as the fore-mention'd Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59609:104"/>which produc'd the Coagulum upon the Mixture of Spirit of Wine and Urine is difficult to be performed, ſince it is a hard Matter to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Spirits fine enough for ſuch a pourpoſe, I ſhall ſubjoyn a more eaſy one, which is, That if Spirit of Salt be added to the White of an Egg beaten to a certain Thinneſs, the Mixture will be ſo much Coagulated as not to afford the leaſt Drop, tho' the Glaſs in which the <hi>Experiment</hi> is tryed, be turn'd with the Mouth downwards for a conſiderable time. And Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> relates an <hi>Experiment</hi> much to the ſame purpoſe; which is, That if the White of an Egg be ſhaken with Spirit of Wine it preſently turn into ſuch a Coagulum as will not yield one Fluid Drop in a Minutes time, and tho' that great Naturaliſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes the Effect of this Mixture, to the Heat of the Spirituous Parts; yet I rather think it the Effect of the particular <hi>Texture</hi> of its <hi>Saline</hi> Parts, ſince other Salts which are accounted cool, have the ſame Effect; And not only ſo but tho' Spirit of Wine will Coagulate the Whites of Eggs, yet it hath not that Effect upon the <hi>Serum</hi> of Mans Blood, tho' the Heat of the Fire will Coagulate the one as well as the other.</p>
                     <p>But it does not only experimentally appear, that a conſiſtent Body may reſult from a Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of two <hi>Fluids,</hi> but alſo that a <hi>Fluid</hi> may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo ſuch an Alteration as to be changed into two Conſiſtent Bodies; and this is evident in diſtilled Sallet Oyl, ſince the Subſtance drawn over is devoid of <hi>Fluidity</hi> as well as that which remains behind; and to make it appear, that the Reaſon of it is the bare reſult of <hi>Texture</hi> and the hooked Figures of its Parts, if we add to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59609:105"/>the Oyl a ſufficient Quantity of Common <hi>Salt,</hi> it affords an Oyl, which falls in drops into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, and retains its <hi>Fluidity.</hi> And to this it may be added, That by adding two pound of <hi>Brandy,</hi> and one of <hi>Sea-Salt</hi> to eight Ounces of Oyl of <hi>Amber,</hi> the Texture of that Oyl was ſo far from being ſo chang'd, as to come over clear and tranſparent; as Eſſential Oyls drawn off in <hi>Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becks,</hi> uſually do. To which we may likewiſe add, That the Texture of Oyl of <hi>Aniſeeds,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd in a <hi>Limbeck</hi> and <hi>Refrigeratory,</hi> with a ſufficient Quantity of Water; will, by the <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Cold, be coagulated into a white brittle Subſtance, tho' it continues Fluid all the <hi>Summer.</hi>

                        <note place="margin">The <hi>Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to their <hi>Flui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,</hi> or <hi>Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mneſs.</hi>
                        </note>And to make it further appear, how much the Alteration of Texture contributes to the <hi>Fluidity,</hi> or <hi>Firmneſs</hi> of Bodies; and to what weak, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt inconſiderable Agents, thoſe Effects may be attributed; I ſhall ſubjoyn another <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which ſhews, that the Particles of a Body may be ſufficiently agitated, to render it Fluid, by another not ſenſibly hot; for having melted coagulated Oyl of <hi>Aniſeeds</hi> by the Fire, and put it into two Glaſſes; the one was congulated again in a ſhort time; yet the other continu'd diſſolv'd, being only cover'd over with a <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum,</hi> in whoſe Parts there is no ſenſible Heat.</p>
                     <p>To this I ſhall add another, of a much like Nature, which is the following. Having pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd ſome of that brittle Gum or <hi>Colophony,</hi> which remains upon the Evaporation of about a fourth Part of <hi>Venice Turpentine,</hi> I mix'd ſo much of it with Spirit of Wine, that, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor being wholly impregnated with it, ſome part might remain undiſſolv'd; which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59609:105"/>had its Parts put into an Agitation, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to render it, in ſome meaſure, a Fluid, tho' a Viſcous Subſtance, notwithſtanding the Force of the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> was ſpent upon what had been diſſolv'd; but tho' this Subſtance was kept in a Fluid Form in the <hi>Menſtruum;</hi> yet in the Air, it would harden in a little time. And in this <hi>Experiment,</hi> it is likewiſe obſervable, That tho', by a violent Agitation, the Viſcid Matter was mix'd with the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> yet it preſently ſeparated, and ſubſided again.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The <hi>Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quots</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to their <hi>Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
                        </note>And this ſuggeſts to my Memory an <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which ſhews how much the Textures of Liquors contribute to their Mixtures with each other; for tho' it be uſually in General aſſerted by the <hi>Chymiſts,</hi> That <hi>Salts</hi> and <hi>Oyls</hi> will not mix together; yet I obtain'd an <hi>Opacous</hi> Liquor, like <hi>Balſam</hi> in Conſiſtence, from a Mixture of an equal weight of Oyl of <hi>Turpentine,</hi> and Oyl of <hi>Vitriol:</hi> And that it might more evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the Mixture of theſe two Fluids, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the peculiar Texture of each, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Mixture to Diſtillation; and obtain'd a groſs Subſtance, which ſeem'd to be that which united the other Liquors: For as ſoon as this was drawn off, the Liquors preſently ſucceeded, but ſeparate one from another, being not to beunited again, by a Violent Agitation, but ſo as to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate again, and ſwim one upon another. To this may be added the Liquor, which we have mention'd in another place, obtain'd by Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from <hi>Benzoin:</hi> One Part of it always continuing in the Form of an Oyl; and the other, according to the Difference of the Weather, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhooting into clear <hi>Cryſtals,</hi> or preſerving
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:59609:106"/>it's Fluid and Oyly Form. To which may be ſubjoyn'd what we have formely taken Notice of concerning <hi>Salt-Petre;</hi> which, tho' when mix'd with Water, it becomes Fluid; yet, upon an Evaporation of ſome Part of that, it preſently ſhoots in Solid <hi>Chryſtals:</hi> From whence it not only appears, what a gentle Agitation of Parts is ſufficient to keep a Body Fluid; but from hence we may obſerve, That ſometimes Solid Bodies reſult from a Mixture of Liquids: So Oyl of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,</hi> diſtill'd with <hi>Quick-ſilver,</hi> leaves a white <hi>Calx</hi> behind it; and if we conſider how <hi>Mercurius Dulcis</hi> is prepar'd, we ſhall find, that that Solid Subſtance conſiſts for the moſt part of <hi>Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver,</hi> the <hi>Salts</hi> united with it being ſcarce one Part of three of the Compoſition. And tho' <hi>Fluidity</hi> be oppoſite to <hi>Solidity,</hi> yet may it conduce to the Production of a Solid Body, ſince thoſe Particles which lie in the Form of a Powder, and are not in a capacity to unite, may, by ſwimming in a Fluid, have the Opportunity of frequent Occurſions, ſo that their Motion bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them often together, they may, in time, be diſpos'd to unite into one Body; which is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in Powder of <hi>Alablaſter;</hi> which, if when it hath been boyl'd for a conſiderable time, it be well burnt, and reduc'd to the Conſiſtence of a thin Pap, with clear Water, will become firm, and admit of, as well as retain, any Form im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd upon it, by the Internal Surface of whatever Mould it is caſt in: Where, that the Parts of the <hi>Alablaſter</hi> are put into Motion, and variouſly agitated in the Water, is evident, from that ſenſible Heat, which for ſome time, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the Affuſion of Water; and this hath been
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59609:106"/>ſufficiently experienc'd, by filling a Glaſs full of this Mixture, which ſome time after it was ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p'd, broke the Viol, and harden'd into a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, correſpondent in ſhape to the Cavity of it; ſeveral Spoons-full of this Liquor it was moiſten'd with, being ſqueez'd out at a Crack, which was made by the Swelling of the Powder; and this Subſtance acquires ſuch a Degree of Firmneſs, as to endure ſeveral ſtrokes with a ſtrong piece of <hi>Iron,</hi> without breaking.</p>
                     <p>But there are ſeveral other Subſtances, which may acquire a greater degree of Solidity, than the Powder of <hi>Alablaſter</hi> burnt; for the Learned <hi>Hydrographer Furnier, Hydrograph. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. relates a Story of a ſort of Sand in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Naples,</hi> near <hi>Cuma</hi> and <hi>Puteoli,</hi> two parts of, which mix'd with a third of <hi>Quick-lime,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a hard Subſtance like <hi>Flint,</hi> when it hath lain or ſome time in the Water: To which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation he ſubjoyns, That the <hi>Lime-aſhes</hi> of a certain <hi>Marble,</hi> near <hi>Tournay</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> being caſt into Water, upon a heap of Stones, petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies to that degree, as to change into a Subſtance as hard as <hi>Marble.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to return to what we have digreſs'd from, That the Variouſly determin'd Motions of the Parts of Matter, contributes to their Union and Coalitions, into Solid Subſtances, appears from thoſe Curious <hi>Salts,</hi> which Spontaneouſly ſhoot and <hi>Cryſtallize</hi> in the Bottom of Spirit of <hi>Harts-Horn,</hi> when it hath been expos'd to the Air for ſeveral Months: For thoſe Particles, by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Occurſions, are by degrees ſo diſpos'd to unite, that at the length thoſe Parts, which
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59609:107"/>are moſt apt to cohere, meeting together, they form exquiſitely figur'd <hi>Cryſtals,</hi> which adhere to the ſides of the Veſſel. And it is not leſs Remarkable, That tho' a Tincture of <hi>Amber,</hi> drawn with pure Spirit of <hi>Wine,</hi> for ſome Years continu'd Fluid; yet, at the laſt, ſome of its Parts were ſo combin'd, as to form little Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of <hi>Amber,</hi> almoſt Spherical in Shape, which adhered partly to the Sides, and partly to the Bottom of the Veſſel.</p>

Secondly, by obſtructing the Motion of the Fluid Parts: And, Thirdly, by altering the Conſtituent Parts of the Fluid, ſo as to render them unapt for Motion, and inclinable to a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual coheſion: So the Particles which conſtitute <hi>Rennet,</hi> by Uniting with ſome Parts of the <hi>Milk</hi> they are mix'd with, link them together, and cauſe them to unite into a <hi>Coagulum;</hi> and that the Parts of the <hi>Rennet</hi> cauſe them to coagulate; and that they unite thoſe Viſcid Parts, and link them together, is plain; ſince it is a uſual Complaint that the <hi>Cheeſe</hi> made where <hi>Rennet</hi> is us'd, taſtes very ſtrong of it.

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59609:107"/>it. To which I ſhall add, That ſome Years paſt, I prepar'd a certain <hi>Salt,</hi> endew'd with Qualities not unlike thoſe aſcrib'd to <hi>Glauber</hi>'s <hi>Sal Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis;</hi> which would not only, like other <hi>Salts,</hi> when diſſolv'd in <hi>Water,</hi> upon Evaporation, ſhoot into <hi>Cryſtals,</hi> it ſelf; but alſo would coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate, and <hi>Cryſtallize</hi> a treble Quantity of <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> with them, which would ſo far put on the Nature of a <hi>Salt,</hi> as to become brittle, and to be reducible to Powder.</p>

And that thoſe ſubtle <hi>Effluvia,</hi> which inſinuate themſelves into the Pores of a Fluid Body, may ſo alter the Texture, as to render it Solid, is more eminently evident, from the Fumes of

                        <hi>Lead,</hi> which Coagulate and harden, <hi>Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver;</hi> and that <hi>Lead,</hi> does really emit ſuch Fumes, is evident, from the Effects which a <hi>Phyſician</hi>] obſerv'd in himſelf; <hi>viz.</hi> both <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting</hi> and <hi>Purging,</hi> by barely holding his Head over melted <hi>Lead,</hi> ſeveral times ſucceſſively. and it hath been obſerv'd by the Famous <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrician</hi> Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> That the Fumes of <hi>Lead,</hi> have, by being ſeveral times melted, been ſo ſpent, that the <hi>Lead,</hi> after the firſt time it was melted, ſometimes loſt it's a Coagulating Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59609:109"/>add the following <hi>Experiment; viz.</hi> That Oyl of <hi>Wax,</hi> being diſtill'd, afforded a Subſtance not unlike <hi>Butter;</hi> which when it had ſtood a while, was diſſolv'd, without the Influence of any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Heat, into a Tranſparent Oyl.</p>

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59609:110"/>I am further confirm'd in this Opinion, becauſe I have obſerv'd ſeveral Cryſtals ſometimes to adhere to the Sides of a Glaſs, in which Oyl of Vitriol was contain'd, which were again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd when expos'd to the open Air into the priſtine Form of Oyl. But it may be further urg'd, as an Argument againſt the Diviſibility of fluid Bodies into ſuch fluid Parts, that if it were ſo, all Bodies would be equally diſpos'd to inſinuate themſelves into the Pores of other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and it would not happen, that one Body ſhould be more inclin'd than another.</p>

                        </note>From what hath been already premis'd it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears likewiſe, What Thoughts we are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain of the Doctrin of the Chymiſts, who aſſert, That Coagulation, Stability, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the Effects of ſaline Parts. For tho' Salt hath a Power to curdle Milk and coagulate other Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors; yet the hardning Properties of it are not the Effects of any inexplicable Qualities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59609:110"/>in it; but of the Shape and Motion of the Particles which conſtitute it, which, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating themſelves into the Pores of a Body, and ſticking ſeveral Parts together, do like a Wire faſten them one to another. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſaline Parts of a Body may thus contribute to the Solidity of it, yet it is not an Ingredient altogether neceſſary; ſince the Parts of a Body may be ſo interwoven, and, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their Figure and Contexture, be ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to Union, as to form a ſolid Body without the Aſſociation of a ſaline Ingredient; beſides, it might be urg'd, That Salts themſelves may eaſily be reduc'd into fluid Subſtances, by a Mixture of Water; and ſeveral of them, as Salt of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will, without the Addition of any other Body, barely by being expos'd to the Air, be render'd fluid.</p>
                     <p>But not to inſiſt upon theſe Inſtances, I ſhall rather deſire to know, what Salt can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to inſinuate it ſelf into, and cauſe Solidity in Mercury, when it coagulates in the Fumes of Lead? Or what Acceſs of ſaline Parts can be imagin'd in the Preparation of Mercury preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated <hi>per ſe?</hi> And it may as well be queſtion'd, how any ſaline Body can penetrate the fine and ſubtle Pores of Glaſs? When, in a cold Night the Water contain'd in it is frozen, and is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſo conſiſtent a Subſtance as Ice. And it may be likewiſe noted, That tho' the Shells of Hens Eggs be ſoft when firſt lay'd, yet they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently harden without the Addition of any other ſaline Ingredient. And that this Effect cannot be wholly attributed to the Influence of the Air, it may be urg'd, that it hath often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:59609:111"/>been obſerv'd, That Shells have been found hard ſeveral times in the very Bodies of the Hens, before they were laid.</p>
                     <p>But that which I look upon to be a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Argument, is, that in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where Eggs are hatch'd by the Influence of a moderate external Heat, that fluid Subſtance is chang'd into ſeveral Parts, of very different Degrees of Conſiſtency, without the Addition of any other Body, or the Acceſſion of a new Salt.</p>
                     <p>But further, I ſhall make uſe of Arguments drawn from the Conceſſions of the moſt Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent of their own Writers; for in tranſmuting of Quick-ſilver into Gold, by a white or red Tincture, the Quantity of it being only a Grain to a Pound of Quick-ſilver; it may juſtly be demanded, How ſo ſmall a Quantity ſhould change ſix or ſeven Thouſand times its Weight, whereas even that Grain is not altogether ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, Part of it being a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſulphureous Subſtance? And it is obſerv'd, that <hi>Helmont</hi> affirms upon his own, as well as the Experience of <hi>Raymond Lully,</hi> that if the <hi>Alkahoſt</hi> were drawn from Quick-ſilver, the fluid Mercury would be ſo coagulated, as to be capable of being reduc'd into a Powder, tho' not the leaſt of the ſaline Liquor was left behind. And I am credibly inform'd that the preſent Duke of <hi>Holſtein</hi> hath by him a certain Glaſs Spirit of Urine, which in cold Weather ſhoots into Cryſtals, and in warm diſſolves into a limpid Liquor, which Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was no otherwiſe prepar'd than by cohoba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the diſtill'd Spirit ſo often, till the whole ſaline urinous Subſtance was brought over uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together into one Maſs.</p>

                     <p>And for a further Confirmation of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin by us deliver'd, to theſe I ſhall add, that it hath been obſerv'd, that if ſo much as Juice of Lemmons falls into a Caldron of Sacharine Syrup, it keeps the whole Maſs from Thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into a Sugar; and this is confirm'd, both by the <hi>French</hi> Publiſher of the Natural and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Hiſtory of the <hi>American</hi> Iſlands, call'd <hi>Les Iſles Antilles</hi> Hiſtor.

                     <p>To theſe Authorities, for a further Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of our Hypotheſis, I ſhall add a few Experiments of my own; and firſt, having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd a Liquor not much inferior in Saltneſs to <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and then put ſmall Fragments of ſolid Harts-horn into it, we found, that they were gradually ſoften'd, the Particles of the Liquor inſinuating themſelves into the Pores of the conſiſtent Body, and rendring it in a few days time of the Conſiſtence of a Mucilage: We mix'd likewiſe Spirit of Vinegar with Salt of Tartar,<note place="margin">An inſipid <hi>Water</hi> drawn from Sp. of <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> &amp; Salt of <hi>Tartar.</hi>
                        </note> till the Ebullition wholly ceas'd, and by Diſtillation obtain'd an inſipid Water from the Mixture; and ſo ſucceſſively pour'd freſh Spirit of Vinegar upon the Mixture, and again extracted the inſipid Water, repeating reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Affuſions and Diſtillations, till the fix'd Salt was ſufficiently impregnated with the Acid Parts of the Vinegar; and then we obtain'd a Mixture, tho' made up of pure and elementary Salts, which ſo far emulated a fluid Body, as to depoſe its ſaline Form when influenc'd by a very moderate Heat.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Camphire</hi> diſſolv'd in Oyl of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,</hi> &amp;c.</note> Again, we mix'd ſome Pieces of Camphire with Oyl of Vitriol, by which they were preſently diſſolv'd into an Oyl, and when violently agitated together, readily mix'd with the Oyl of Vitriol, and ſeem'd to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a uniform Liquor for ſeveral Hours; yet by an Addition of four times as much fair Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Camphire preſently aſſum'd its own Form again, and ſwam upon the Top of the Liquor; where it is to be noted, That the ſaline Parts of the Oyl of Vitriol render the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59609:112"/>Fluid, inſtead of making it more Solid; and on the contrary, that Fluid is turned into a Conſiſtent Body again, by a Body ſo much void of Saltneſs as Water.</p>
                     <p>And that a Body may acquire thoſe other Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, <hi>viz.</hi> Hardneſs and Brittleneſs, without an Addition of <hi>Saline</hi> Parts, is evident, from the different Tempers that may be given to a Piece of Steel; for if it be immerged in Water red hot, it acquires a Brittleneſs and Hardneſs, which it hath not, if leiſurely cooled in the Air; yet if it be again heated till it turns to a deep Blue, it acquires a comparative ſoftneſs and apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to bend. And that an Alteration in <hi>Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> is enough to render a Body more or leſs Solid, is evident in Snow; for its Parts being compreſſed more cloſely together, it is abler to reſiſt the Impreſſions of other Bodies; and yet when further, by thawing it, it's Parts are brought cloſer together, it hath a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Solidity and Firmneſs, when Froze a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; the <hi>Texture</hi> being much more cloſe and compact, than that of the Snow.</p>
                     <p>But by ſome it is taught, that Induration de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on a certain inward Principle,<note place="margin">A Plaſtick power inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note> or a Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Power, called by ſome a <hi>Form</hi> and by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers a <hi>Petrifying Spirit,</hi> lodged in a Liquid <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle.</hi> And indeed, ſince I have obſerved, that ſome Stones dug out of the Earth are endewed with ſuch curious and exquiſite Figures, as if they had been the product of Art; I cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a Plaſtick Power, which the wiſe Creator of Things hath implanted in certain Particles of Matter, which produce both the determinate Figure as well as conſiſtnce of thoſe
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:59609:113"/>Bodies:<note place="margin">Plaſtick Power what?</note> But we diſagree with the generality of thoſe <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> as to the Manner in which this internal Principle produces its Effects; and ſince the Manner of it, by them, is not intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligibly explained, it will be neceſſary to Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how many ways Nature takes to render Bodies Solid, by which we ſhall be better Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd to Judge of the Manner which thoſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles operate by, in which the Plaſtick Power is ſaid to lodge.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed; For as much as Hardneſs is the higheſt degree of Firmneſs, we ſhall endeavour to make it appear, that an Alteration of <hi>Texture,</hi> concurring with other diſpoſitions of the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Parts of a Body, is enough to render it hard without the Addition of an adventitious <hi>Salt.</hi>

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:59609:114"/>to determine, how much, the Infiuence of the Air contributes to the hardning of them: For <hi>Gaſſendus in Vita Piereskii.</hi> lib. 1. ſays, he hath obſerved in the leſſer Streams of the River <hi>Rhoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> where he uſually waſhed himſelf, ſeveral Lumps of hard Subſtances, upon the ſame Place, where he was wont to find the ground ſmooth and ſoft; and that ſome time after, the ſame hard Subſtances remaining in the Water, as well as ſome which he carried home with him, were turned into perfect Pebbles; from which relations, and alſo what we have before obſerved concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Powder of Alablaſter, it appears, how much the Mechanical <hi>Textures</hi> of Bodies, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with other Mechanical Qualities contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to their various Forms; for beſides the aforementioned Inſtances I have obſerved, that that bony Subſtánce, ſo much eſteemed by <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians,</hi> which is uſually taken out of the Deer's <hi>Heart,</hi> and is of a hard Conſiſtence, hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd, in one of thoſe Creatures which I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely look'd into, to be ſoft and flexible like <hi>Cartilages.</hi>

                     <p>And if we will give Credit to <hi>Aventinus</hi> as well as ſome other Authors, he hath recorded, in his Hiſtory, that ſeveral Men and Women were at once Petrify'd by a <hi>Terrene</hi> Spirit, and changed into Statues; that Petrifying exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

And it is Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by <hi>Pamphilio Pixcentino,</hi> of a Woman in <hi>Venice,</hi> who upon eating of an <hi>Apple,</hi> was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into a very hard Stone, after ſhe had been hideouſly tortured for about 24 hours;<note place="margin">Mixture ſufficient to produce Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifaction.</note> which Hiſtory together with Obſervations of my own, which I ſhall add, will be a good Argument to prove, that even Mixture is ſufficient to petrify ſome Bodies; the Obſervation is in the following <hi>Experiment, viz.</hi> If two Ounces of <hi>Quick-ſilver</hi> be mixed with two Ounces and a half of <hi>Verdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeſe,</hi> together with about an Ounce of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Salt, and put into a Frying Pan; when that Mixture hath been Boiled for a conſiderable time, with an equal Quantity of Vinegar and Water, gradually infus'd, as it waſts by Effluvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums, the Mixture, waſhed and cleanſed from its Salts, will afford an Amalgama not unlike <hi>Quick-ſilver;</hi> which, if Dexterouſly prepared, may be caſt into Moulds and formed into imboſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages; and it is in this Amalgama very remarkable, that tho' at the firſt it is ſo ſoft, as in a great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to emulate a <hi>Fluid</hi> Body; yet when for ſome hours expoſed to the Air, it becomes hard and as Brittle as Steel; where the Induration ſeems to reſult from the Coalitions of the mixed Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, and their new Texture, rather than from any innate Principle; The Particles of the Fluid Mercury being ſo intangled and interwoven one with another, as to loſe their former Fluidity,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59609:115"/>and to convene ſo cloſely as to unite into a Solid Body. And that the Induration depends on a Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Combination of the Saline Ingredients with the Mercury, is beyond doubt; ſince not only a true and perfect Copper may be obtained from the Amalgama; but when it hath been for ſome time expoſed to the Air, the Surface will be covered over with the Saline Parts of the Verdigreeſe, which have freed themſelves from their more intimate commixture with the metalline Particles of the condenſed Quick-Silver.</p>
                     <p>But leſt it ſhould be Queſtioned, whether the Particles of Salt can have any ſenſible Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when mixed with a Body ſo firm as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens'd Quick-Silver, I ſhall add, that in Bodies much more firm, it hath been obſerv'd, <hi>viz.</hi> in thoſe Stones from which Vitriol is got; for it is remarkable in them, that when they have been for ſome time expoſed to the open Air, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Agitation of the Saline Parts, is ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that ſeveral of them will not only ſwell, but even burſt aſunder. And I remember that having preſer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>'d a Mineral, much of the ſame Nature with theſe Stones, in my Chamber, the Superficies was cover'd with a Powder, both in Colour and Taſte reſembling Vitriol.</p>
                     <p>And that the Motion of the Parts of this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malgama, whilſt it was Fluid, which they might be put into, by the external force of the Fire, might contribute to their Concretion, we have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Reaſons to believe, from what is related and obſerv'd by experienc'd Maſons, <hi>viz.</hi> That the beſt Morter will not acquire it's utmoſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pactneſs, under 25 or 30 Years, and that, after
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:59609:116"/>a long time, it becomes ſo hard, as to be more unapt to break than the Stones it Cements.</p>
                     <p>But laſtly, that the Condenſation of the Parts of the <hi>Quickſilver,</hi> depends on the Mixture of the Ingredients, and the Texture thence reſulting, is evident; ſince the Proportion of the Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients being vary'd, the Condenſation of the <hi>Mercury</hi> was neither ſo ſpeedy, nor ſo firm.</p>
                     <p>And that it may appear, That <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Art</hi> ſometimes take Meaſures not unlike, in the Hardning of Bodies, I ſhall add a Paſſage from a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> nam'd <hi>Pierre Belleprat,</hi> who relates it as an Obſervation in the <hi>American</hi> Continent, where he was ſent to preach to the <hi>Indians:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A Strange Sort of <hi>Earth.</hi>
                        </note> The Relation is, That near the Mouth of the River, there is to be found a Green ſort of Clay, which being ſoft, and capable of being put into any Form, whilſt under Water, grows ſo hard when expos'd to the Air, as not to be much ſofter than Diamonds; and this, he ſays, the Natives uſually make Hatchets of, which they cut their Wood in pieces with.

                        </note>To conclude this <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> I ſhall add an <hi>Experiment,</hi> which will be a farther Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That <hi>Fluidity</hi> and <hi>Firmneſs,</hi> depend on <hi>Texture,</hi> and the Motion or Reſt of the Inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Parts of Matter. The <hi>Experiment</hi> is, That having made a Solution of <hi>Coral</hi> in <hi>Vinegar,</hi> ſo ſtrong, that part of it fell to the Bottom; I pour'd Dephlegm'd Spirit of <hi>Wine,</hi> upon the Clear Decantated Liquor, ſo gently, that it might ſwim upon it for ſome time; where it was ſuprizing, that upon a violent Agitation, the two Liquors being mix'd together, united into a <hi>Concrete</hi> ſo firm, as not to afford the leaſt
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:59609:116"/>Drop of a Fluid Liquor; yet by adding an equal quantity or thereabouts of Spirit of <hi>Nitre,</hi> it would again lay down that <hi>Viſcidity,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Tranſparent Liquor.</p>
                     <p>And here it will not be amiſs to ſpecify, That this <hi>Experiment</hi> is ſo difficult, that it ſcarce ſucceeds, without a great deal of Caution; for, Firſt, If the <hi>Tincture</hi> be not ſtrong enough, or the Spirit of <hi>Wine</hi> not rectify'd, the <hi>Coagulation</hi> will be but partial, and not ſo quick: Secondly, The <hi>Experiment</hi> hath ſucceeded in a Wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth'd Glaſs, where it had a free acceſs of <hi>Air,</hi> tho' it would not in one which was cloſer: Thirdly, Upon an Infuſion of Spirit of <hi>Nitre,</hi> the Mixture muſt be ſtirr'd with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, made of <hi>Gold, Wood,</hi> or <hi>Glaſs,</hi> leſt the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> corroding it, ſhould render the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment</hi> unſucceſsful: And Fourthly, The quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of each of theſe Ingredients is hard to be defin'd, by Reaſon of the Difference in reſpect of the Strength of the <hi>Tincture,</hi> and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituouſneſs of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> but it is rather to be learnt, by Varying the Proportions, if the firſt Tryal does not ſucceed.</p>
                     <p>Having made this Progreſs in the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>Fluidity,</hi> and <hi>Firmneſs;</hi> It might be ſeaſonable to paſs on, and conſider thoſe other Qualities relating to it; as <hi>Hardneſs, Brittleneſs, Softneſs, &amp;c.</hi> but remembring the Advice given by ſome of the Ancients, <hi>Noſcenda est Menſura ſui;</hi> I ſhall leave them for others, who are better able and more at leiſure; being content, that I have explain'd the two former Qualities more Intelligibly, than ſome of the <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> or <hi>Chymiſts;</hi> having lay'd open a Way to accommodate <hi>Chymical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments,</hi>

In favour of which Opinion, were it neceſſary, I ſhould offer Arguments <hi>à priori,</hi> deduc'd from the Doctrin of the <hi>Epicurean</hi> and <hi>Carteſian</hi> Principles.</p>
                     <p>For ſhould we allow the World to ariſe from a Caſual Concourſe of <hi>Atoms,</hi> and that there were actual Motion in all of them; it would not be abſurd to think, That tho' in Forming <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes,</hi> they are uſually wound one within another,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:59609:117"/>yet there is a continual Endeavour to <hi>Elaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,</hi> by which they continually ſtrive to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entangle themſelves, and to fly away, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the Reſult of thoſe Endeavours muſt be a <hi>Motion</hi> amongſt thoſe <hi>Atoms.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And on the other ſide, ſhould we, with <hi>Carteſius,</hi> allow a Continual Circulation of a <hi>Materia Subtilis</hi> through the Pores of Bodies, we may imagine, That the Inſenſible <hi>Atoms,</hi> which conſtitute that Body, will be ſhak'd and diſturb'd by it, tho' not ſo much as to be perceiv'd by Senſe: So in the <hi>Summer,</hi> the Leaves are carry'd off the Trees with gentle Gales of Wind, which are not perceiv'd by thoſe that ſtand ſome Diſtance off.</p>
                     <p>But not to enlarge upon this Point, it may appear, from ſeveral of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd above in the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>Fluidity,</hi> that the Particles of Bodies may be in Motion, tho' that Motion is not diſcern'd; and Particularly, that of <hi>Water;</hi> where tho' its Parts be in a very Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Motion, yet to Senſe they ſeem to be as much at Reſt, as thoſe, which form the Glaſs, in which the Water is contain'd. And that there may be a like Motion, in the Subſtance of <hi>Silver</hi> or <hi>Iron,</hi> may be argu'd from what is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the Touch, or by throwing Water upon them when hot, it being peculiar Properties in them when hot, to burn the Fingers, and to ſet the Water a-boiling; and the like Qualities, tho' not ſo violent, may be rais'd without the help of Fire, by barely Hammering of <hi>Iron,</hi> or <hi>Silver;</hi> they not only, by that means, acquiring a Power to heat, but likewiſe to raiſe Water into Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Argument <hi>to prove</hi> Motion <hi>in</hi> Solids.</note>But if to this it ſhould be objected, That tho' the Motion be indiſcernible; yet the Agent that gives it that Motion is not, ſince we can diſcern how thoſe Qualities are added to it, and how the Alteration is wrought: I anſwer, That tho' a Vigorous <hi>Loadſtone,</hi> appears to be drawn along it's Axis, and back again, the Alteration is not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in the Body of the <hi>Iron;</hi> yet it certainly loſes, after it hath acquir'd, thoſe Noble Faculties, <hi>viz.</hi> it's Attracting and Directing Virtues properly belonging to <hi>Magnetical</hi> Bodies: But, that there may be in <hi>Metals</hi> a Motion, tho' not diſcernible, is further evident in a <hi>Bell;</hi> which a long time after it has been ſtruck with the Clapper, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to put the Air into an Undulating Motion; and thereby to cauſe very odd Sounds; which muſt be an Argument, that the Partieles of that <hi>Bell</hi> are in a very nimble Agitation; otherwiſe they could not communicate Motion to the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambient Air, and thereby cauſe ſuch a Noiſe in the Ear.</p>
                     <p>But I muſt confeſs there are two Difficulties,<note place="margin">Objections <hi>anſwer'd.</hi>
                        </note> which occur to what I have been offering: As Firſt, That it is hard to imagin, how the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Parts of ſuch Solid Bodies ſhould be work'd upon, by Agents ſo weak as the Air, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſome parts of Matter more Minute, which are diſpers'd through it: And Secondly, It may be queſtion'd how any Parts of Matter can be mov'd ſo ſlow, if at all, as to be ſo long in moving from the Internal Parts of a Needle, to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies, as our <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> requires: But,</p>
                     <p>To the Firſt, I anſwer, That thoſe External Parts are not the ſole Cauſes of theſe Motions, but only aſſiſtant to the Principal; which is evident from
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:59609:118"/>what hath lately been noted concerning the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> Diſpoſitions to Motion, attributed to Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, according to the <hi>Epicurean</hi> and <hi>Carteſian Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy;</hi> and by the Effects of a <hi>Loadſtone</hi> upon the Needle, we may be taught to gueſs, what laſting Changes may be produc'd, in the Textures of Bodies, by the Influence of very Inſenſible Parts of Matter. And as for the other Part of the Objection, <hi>viz.</hi> The Slowneſs of Motion, which Nature makes uſe of in ſome of her Works, are altogether as inconceivable, as the Motion of a Shadow upon a Dial, or of an Index upon a Clock: And Nature may upon other Accounts, and undoubtedly does, make uſe of Motion in a degree yet more remiſs. But not to inſiſt upon the Slowneſs of Motion, which Nature makes uſe of, it may be otherwiſe offer'd againſt this Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that the Motion of the Inſenſible Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles of a <hi>Loadſtone</hi> cannot be ſuppos'd to be in a Direct Line, ſince they muſt not only paſs through Pores very crooked and intricate, but muſt alſo meet with ſeveral other Particles of Matter, which will oppoſe them; and not only drive them back, but alſo make their Paſſage ſtill more intricate and winding, by driving them from one ſide to another, as well as ſeveral other ways, by which their Motion may be retarded. Beſides it is but Reaſonable to ſuppoſe, That it is much more eaſy to keep a heavy Body in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in its own <hi>Medium,</hi> than to remove it from that to another.</p>
                     <p>But to decline <hi>Speculations,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Inſtances <hi>alledg'd.</hi>
                        </note> I ſhall bring Inſtances to confirm what I am about to prove, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Corpuſcles, which conſtitute Bodies, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to Motion, and that their Motion is
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:59609:119"/>very ſlow: The firſt Inſtance I ſhall mention, is in a Spring made of <hi>Steel,</hi> which, tho' it be preſs'd and ſqueez'd together for ſome time, it will, upon a Ceſſation of that Preſſure again, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend it ſelf, and recover its former Poſition; but if it be kept long in that compreſs'd Poſture, it will by degrees loſe that Power of Reſtitution, and continue in its crooked and unbended Figure: From whence we may learn, That tho' <hi>Elaſtick</hi> Parts may be endu'd with an Endeavour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand themſelves, yet they may be a long while in working their Effect; ſince we ſee, that <hi>Steel</hi> being put into a Springy Form, retains that Springineſs for a long time.</p>

                        </note>But to confirm what I have been diſcourſing of, and to evince what conſiderable Changes the Air may Effect in the moſt Solid Bodies; I ſhall add this Obſervation, <hi>viz.</hi> That if one End of a Bar of <hi>Iron,</hi> held perpendicularly, be apply'd to the Point of a <hi>Mariner</hi>'s Compaſs, it will force it away towards the <hi>East</hi> or <hi>West;</hi> but if the Poſition of that Bar be alter'd, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently loſes its Magnetical Qualities: Yet it is obſerv'd, That if this <hi>Iron</hi> Bar be kept long in a Window, it's Magnetick Qualities become much more durable and conſtant; from whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, That the Air together with the Magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>Effluvia</hi> of the Earth, may work changes very laſting upon the Particles of Solid Bodies, by inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating themſelves into their Pores; and that the Motion, which muſt needs be concern'd in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering their Texture, muſt likewiſe be very ſlow, ſince it cannot in a little time acquire ſuch Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netical Virtues.</p>

                     <p>But to proceed to a further Confirmation of what we have deliver'd, the firſt Obſervation I take Notice of is, that it is uſnally obſerv'd, That if <hi>Lignum Vitae,</hi> which is one of the hardeſt Woods, be work'd before it be ſufficiently ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd, it will be very fragile, and ſubject to break; ſo that curiouſly work't Veſſels expos'd to the <hi>Sun,</hi> have broke in pieces: And it hath been obſerv'd likewiſe, That ſeveral Cavities have been found in the Subſtance of it, full of a certain Gum, which ſome People much eſteem in <hi>Venereal</hi> Diſtempers; to which may be added, That in the Seaſoning of this Wood, for ſome particular uſes, it is requiſite to keep it longer than others, ſo that leſs than twenty Years will not make it fit for ſome uſes. From whence we may infer, That if this Wood requires ſo long time to acquire it's utmoſt Compactneſs, and to evaporate its Watery Parts, the Motion of thoſe evaporated Particles, muſt not only be very laſting, and durable, but ſlow.</p>
                     <p>And if it be allow'd, that thoſe Gummy Parts were collected in their Cells, after the Felling of the Tree, as it is highly probable, it will be further to our Advantage, becauſe it ſhews how the Parts of a Groſs Body do permeate the fine Pores of a very Solid and Inanimate Subſtance; where the Motion muſt need be very inſenſible and ſlow. But what is more ſtrange, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, that the Wood of which certain Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Inſtruments are made, ſometimes, tho a much ſofter Wood than <hi>Lignum Vitae,</hi> requires at leaſt forty Years Seaſoning, and does not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire its beſt Reſonance under Fourſcore.</p>

                     <p>But further, That there is not only a Change of Texture in Solid Vegetable Subſtances, but even in <hi>Stony Concretes,</hi> appears from what is obſerv'd in Building;<note place="margin">Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>made in</hi> Quarries.</note> where ſome Walls acquire not their Utmoſt Solidity under forty Years. To which I ſhall add, what is further obſerv'd in ſomes <hi>Quarries</hi> by <hi>Maſons:</hi> And Firſt, that there are <hi>Marchaſites</hi> to be found, which being much more hard than Stones or Marble, and which conſiſt as well of a Metalline, as a Stony Subſtance; yet have ſuch a Degree of Motion in their Parts, as not only to burſt, but, if long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the Air, to be cover'd over with <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triolate Effloreſcences.</hi> To this I ſhall add, That an Ingenious Friend of mine had a <hi>Turquoiſe</hi>-Stone, in which there were certain Spots of different Colours from the Gem it ſelf, which were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to ſhift their places ſeveral times; which that there might be no doubt of, I employ'd one to take the Picture of it with thoſe Spots in it, at ſeveral diſtant times, one after another, which Pictures, when compar'd, ſhew'd, that the Spots had ſhifted their Places; having paſs'd up and down through the Subſtance of ſo ſolid a Gem, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſlowly, in a Figure as irregular. And I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by a <hi>Jeweller,</hi> that he once had one of theſe Stones, which had a different Blue in two ſeveral Parts of the Stone; and that, in ſome time, the one overſpread the whole, and mix'd with the other: And an Ingenious Friend of mine told me, That he had obſerv'd a certain Cloud in an <hi>Agate,</hi> to move ſeveral times from one place to another.</p>

                        </note>But there is not only an Inteſtin Motion of Parts in ſuch Solid Subſtances as theſe, but in Bodies
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:59609:120"/>look'd upon to be of the Cloſeſt and moſt Compact Textures; for I have now a <hi>Diamond</hi> by me, which being rubb'd, will eaſily become <hi>Electri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> and ſhine in the Dark; which Qualities can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be added to it, without a Change of Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and that in altering that Texture, there is an Internal Motion of Parts, will eaſily be evinc'd; becauſe, otherwiſe the Texture could not be chang'd; and further, becauſe a very gentle Agent is ſufficient to put the Parts of a <hi>Diamond</hi> in Motion.</p>
                     <p>And to this Relation I ſhall add, That I have often obſerv'd, a Dulneſs and Clearneſs to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed each other, in a <hi>Diamond,</hi> which I now have ſet in a Ring with the Former, which Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges could be attributed to no Manifeſt Cauſe: And I have obſerv'd no leſs ſuprizing a Change, in the ſeveral Degrees of <hi>Electricity,</hi> which could not be effected by any Cauſe that I could think of: And I have been inform'd, by one who had a certain <hi>Hungarian Diamond,</hi> that it would acquire a much greater Degree of Sprightneſs, by lying ſome time in Water: From all which it appears, That Conſiderable Changes may be effected in <hi>Diamonds,</hi> by Agents, which, to Senſe, Operate very gently. And if <hi>Diamonds</hi> are generated in the Earth, as I have obſerv'd other Stones to be; it is reaſonable to think, that the Hardneſs of their Subſtance, proceeds from the Cloſeneſs of their Parts, depending on the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtin Motion of their Inſenſible Corpuſcles, by which they are brought to convene cloſer than ordinary: And this I am rather Inclin'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, becauſe I have been told by an Eminent <hi>Jeweller,</hi> That the <hi>Diamonds</hi> of late Years, are
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:59609:121"/>much more ſoft than thoſe he formerly us'd to deal in: And the truth of this is further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, by what <hi>Egrezes</hi> a <hi>Frenchman</hi> writes of <hi>Diamonds, P. M.</hi> 17, 18. brought from the <hi>Mine,</hi> call'd <hi>Gazerpoli;</hi> the Senſe of the Words is this: <hi>They are very clear, and of a good Water, but they cannot be ground by Mutual Attrition, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept with Stones of the ſame</hi> Mine: <hi>for if one ſhould employ for that purpoſe, the Stones of another</hi> Mine, <hi>thoſe of</hi> Gazerpoli <hi>would be broken in pieces: They do alſo eaſily break upon the Wheel, and thoſe that are not vers'd in the Knowledge of Stones, may be eaſily deceiv'd in them.</hi> And the ſame Author, ſpeaking of another ſort of <hi>Diamonds,</hi> ſays, That they ſweat a ſort of Unctuous Subſtance, which being wip'd off, as often renew it's Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. And to theſe I ſhall add an Account of a <hi>Ruby,</hi> which is one of the hardeſt <hi>Diamonds,</hi> one of which a Lady, nearly related to me, wore up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her Finger; which would often change it's Luſtre, the Cauſe of which could not be aſſign'd; tho' theſe kind of <hi>Phaenomena</hi> ſeem to be the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of ſome Internal Motion in their Parts, the Parts of <hi>Diamonds</hi> being capable of having their Parts put into Motion, without much difficulty.</p>
                     <p>But tho' it be hence Evident, That there is ſuch an Inteſtin Motion of the Parts of <hi>Diamonds;</hi> yet it may be thought ſtrange, to find the like in ſo firm and compact a Body as <hi>Glaſs.</hi> But that the Parts of <hi>Glaſs</hi> are not always at <hi>Rest,</hi> I am induc'd to believe, by the following Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Firſt, That ſeveral Plates of <hi>Venice-Glaſs,</hi> have crack'd and broke in pieces, when no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Agent could have any Senſible Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on them; which I conceive to proceed
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:59609:121"/>from a Redundancy of <hi>Saline</hi> Parts, which ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to fly away, break the Glaſs by their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Motion; which Conjecture I am confirm'd in, ſince it is commonly obſerv'd,<note place="margin">The Parts of <hi>Glaſs</hi> in <hi>Motion.</hi>
                        </note> That there is a <hi>Saline</hi> Subſtance, adhering to the Surface of theſe Glaſſes in Cold Moiſt Weather. And I have obſerv'd in a Glaſs, into which too much Salt was put, to make it Diaphanous, ſeveral Cracks and Flaws, which it got in the Cold Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: So that it rather appears to be a white, than a Glaſs-Cup at a Diſtance. And I, as well as thoſe that deal much amongſt Glaſſes, have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, ſeveral to fly in pieces, when there was no outward Agent, to be the Cauſe of ſuch an Effect; and I am inform'd by an Ingenious Man, who is Maſter of a Glaſs-Houſe, That near a Third Part of a parcel of Glaſſes, flew in pieces of their own accord, after they had been kept for about five Years pack'd up. To which I might add ſeveral other Inſtances, to prove and illuſtrate the Doctrin above-deliver'd.</p>
                     <p>For theſe <hi>Phaenomena</hi> may be, and are, very Naturally accounted for, by the Corpuſcular <hi>Philoſophy;</hi> for ſuppoſing, the Particles of Glaſs to be in a continual <hi>Elaſtick</hi> Endeavour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand themſelves, and fly away; and that ſeveral of thoſe Particles are got together, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that they break and diſ-joint thoſe Parts of the United Glaſs, which are leaſt able to reſiſt, and keep them from Expanſion. And to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance this Explanation, I ſhall add, That ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Alkalizate,</hi> or other ſmall Parts of Matter, being inclos'd in the Body of a Glaſs, it is always apter to break, eſpecially at that place, from
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:59609:122"/>whence ſeveral Cracks ſpread themſelves as from a Centre.</p>
                     <p>But whether the <hi>Elaſticity</hi> of theſe Parts, be promoted by any Subtile Bodies, which penetrate the Glaſs, I ſhall not now ſtay to examine; but ſhall rather proceed to acquaint You, That in a conſiderable Space of Time, the Texture of Glaſs may be ſo alter'd, as to be more unapt to give a free Paſſage to <hi>Aether</hi> it ſelf, or any other Subtle Body, which could penetrate it before; and conſequently thoſe Bodies Endeavouring to make their way, tho' oppos'd by it's Texture, cauſe a Proportionable Crack, or Diſſolution of the Subſtance of the Glaſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the</hi> Inteſtine Motion <hi>of the Parts of</hi> Glaſs.</note>And to what we have deliver'd concerning <hi>Glaſs,</hi> theſe Obſervations are not altogether diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable; <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, That it is a Subſtance, which by being rubb'd eaſily, becomes <hi>Electrical;</hi> which is an Argument, that the Parts of it may without any great difficulty, be put into Motion. Secondly, The Parts of <hi>Glaſs</hi> may fly aſunder, if the Neighbouring Parts be put into Motions diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to each other; which is evident, if a hot Glaſs be immediately put into cold Water: for the Motion of it's Corpuſcles, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally checked, thoſe which within remain in a violent Agitation, cauſe a ſudden Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
                     <p>To which may be added, That tho' one would think the Particles of Glaſs were ſo fix'd, as to become unfit to alter their Figure and Shape; yet their Parts continuing in ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Agitation, they may, by inviſible and inſenſible Agents, be ſo work'd upon, as to be
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:59609:122"/>forc'd to alter their Shape and Size: In confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which, it may be obſerv'd, That White and pure Tranſparent Glaſs, will in a little time, become very unfit to be put again into the Moulds they were firſt caſt in.</p>
                     <p>But tho' I have mention'd both theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, by which the Cracking of Glaſſes, may be accounted for, to ſhew, that which ſoever of them we allow, they will be Proof of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine Motion in the Parts of Glaſs; yet I will neither examine or determine which of them is rather to be rely'd on; but ſhall only obſerve, That the Motion of their Parts muſt needs be very ſlow; ſince it is ſo long before it ſhews its Effects.</p>
                     <p>And now to conclude, tho' from what hath been deliver'd, it may be expected that I ſhould draw Conſequences, to determine whether there be abſolute <hi>Rest</hi> in Bodies, or no, I ſhall omit that, and only intimate, That it is not abſurd to doubt, nor improbable to think, that there is not; ſince it hath been diſcover'd in Bodies, which are uſually eſteem'd, moſt Quieſcent.</p>

                     <p>THO' ſeveral Mathematicians, as well as Philoſophers,<note place="margin">Several <hi>Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> ariſing from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heeded <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</hi>
                        </note> have exercis'd their Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry in limiting the Laws of Motion; yet ſince ſeveral Qualities uſually eſteem'd occult, may ariſe from a faint and unheeded Motion of the Parts of thoſe Bodies, to which they are attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, I ſhall conſider the Extent of local Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a little further: But before I proceed to conſider the particular Effects of languid and unheeded Motion, I ſhall firſt premiſe, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, what I have elſewhere upon another Occaſion intimated, <hi>viz.</hi> That we are not to conſider Bodies, barely as ſo many Portions of Matter endow'd with particular Powers; but as Bodies whoſe Particles are variouſly figur'd and modify'd after a peculiar Manner; ſo as to act or to be acted on by thoſe Bodies which are about them; yet not wholly to derive their Effects to the Influence of external Agents, but in a great Meaſure from the mutual Action of one Part of Matter upon another.</p>
                     <p>But there are ſeveral other Circumſtances of local Motion, beſides what we have taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, which are not to be diſcern'd; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would not be thought wholly to attribute the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of a Body to Motion only but to
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:59609:123"/>a Concurrence of ſeveral other Cauſes; but to avoid tedious Preambles, I ſhall take notice that the Reaſons why ſome Men ſlight or overlook the ſtrange Effects of languid Motion may be compriz'd under the following Heads.</p>
                     <div type="proposition">
                        <head>I.<note place="margin">

                           <hi>Men are wont to overlook the great Efficacy of Celerity, in Bodies which are very ſmall: And eſpecially, if the Space which they move through be but ſmall.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>What ſtrange Effects may be deriv'd from rapid, tho' undiſcerned Motion, we have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Inſtance in Bullets, which by reaſon of their ſwift Motion, are able to effect more than thoſe battering Engines of the Ancients, which were of a vaſte Bulk in compariſon of Bullets, which are ſhot out of the largeſt Canons: To this I might add ſeveral other Inſtances, but I ſhall rather proceed to alledge, in favour of the ſecond Part of the Propoſition, that I have often obſerv'd, That the Particles of Iron, which fly off Iron Rods, when they are turn'd, affected my Hand with a ſenſible Heat, if held at a ſmall Diſtance; and it is likewiſe obſerv'd by thoſe who work in Braſs, That the Particles which fly off upon turning, affect their Eyes, as well as other Parts, with an offenſive Heat; ſo that an experienc'd Workman ſhew'd me a Bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter upon his Hand, which was rais'd by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe Heat of Particles of Braſs thrown off by a rough Tool. And I am further inform'd, That in turning of great Guns, the Parts which fly off are ſo hot as to burn the Fingers of thoſe, who offer'd to take them up: Amongſt which
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:59609:124"/>Obſervations it is to be noted, That Braſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a much greater Heat in turning than Iron.</p>
                        <p>And to theſe Obſervations I ſhall add, That not only the Parts of Metals, but Wood, will become in ſome Meaſure warm, by being put into a rapid Motion by the Force of the Turners Engines; from which Inſtances it appears how conſiderable are the Effects of a rapid, tho' a ſhort Motion.</p>
                        <p>And we have Inſtances of this kind no leſs remarkable in Vegetables, where a good Cane by being ſtruck with a Piece of Flint, emits Sparks not unlike Flint in a Moment of Time; and the like ſucceeds, if Loaf-ſugar be dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly ſcrap'd, ſo as to put its Parts into a brisk Agitation: But what is moſt worthy to be obſerv'd in Flint is, That it's Parts being put into a brisk Motion by another Piece of Flint, will not only aſſume the Form of Fire, but as the Ingenious Mr. <hi>Hooke</hi> hath obſerv'd, will be vitrify'd, tho' in Glaſſ-houſes both an intenſe Heat and an Addition of ſome <hi>Borillia</hi> are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to bring Sand or Flint to Fuſion and to vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy them: And that this Vitrification is made of the Portions of the Flint put into a brisk Motion, I am induc'd to believe, becauſe one Piece of Flint will ſtrike Fire upon another, without the Aſſiſtance of a Piece of Steel; and Fire may not only be ſtruck out of Flint, but Bodies much harder, as Diamonds, which when grated on in a Mill have their Parts put into ſuch a Motion, as to conſtitute Flame, though the moſt intenſe Degree of Heat will not diſſolve them; and even the Parts of fluid
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:59609:124"/>Bodies, if put into a brisk Motion, may have conſiderable Effects upon ſolid Bodies; for whether, the Beams of the Sun conſiſt of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, which flow in direct Phyſical Lines from the Sun, or are only contiguous Matter, as the <hi>Carteſians</hi> think, put into a ſucceſſive Motion, yet it is enough to countenance what is here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd, that that Matter thrown into a <hi>Focus</hi> will melt Lead, Tin, or foliated Silver and Gold, and in a little time ſet green Wood on Fire. And how the ſmall Parts of fluid Bodies will affect conſiſtent and ſolid ones, will be further evident from Inſtances alledg'd under the fourth Head.</p>

Nor are the Effects of the Air in a Wind-gun upon a Bullet leſs to be admir'd; it's Parts upon the Account of their Springyneſs, being put into a violent Motion; for when the Air is permitted to expand, by affecting the Bullet no longer than whilſt it paſſes through the Barrel of the Gun, the Bullet acquires ſuch a Degree of Motion, as, upon it's being ſhot againſt a Plate of Metal, to be preſs'd into the Shape of an Hemiſphere; and the Particles of the Bullet will be put into ſo conſiderable a Degree of Motion, by ſtriking againſt the Plate, that I could ſcarce hold it betwixt my Fingers.</p>

                        <p>By the Motion of fluid Bodies I would be underſtood to mean, not that which may be diſcover'd by the Eye or Touch, but the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perciev'd Motion of their inſenſible Parts; of the Effects of which, I might alledge ſeveral Inſtances from the Operations of Sounds upon ſolid Bodies; for upon the Diſcharge of great Guns, the Sound of their Exploſion is not only heard a great way; but the expanding Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder gives ſuch a Motion to the Air, as to enable it to break Glaſs Windows at a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable diſtance. And tho' to this it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, That ſince the Cannon ſtands on the ſame Piece of Ground with the Houſes whoſe Windows are ſo broke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Effect may proceed from a tremulous Motion continu'd by the Soyl it ſtands on, yet the following Inſtance will make it appear, That the Parts of a Liquid being put into Motion may have ſuch Effects; tho' it is not to be deny'd, but that a tremulous Motion may be given to the Earth, ſo violent as to be extended to a greater Diſtance; the Inſtance is, That the Water hath been put into ſo violent a Motion by an Engine contriv'd to ſink Ships, that it ſhak'd ſeveral Ships which were at a conſiderable diſtance, ſo ſtrongly, that thoſe who were on the Decks could ſcarce ſtand.</p>
                        <p>And in the late great Sea-Fight between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> tho' they engag'd at ſeveral Leagues Diſtance from the <hi>Hague;</hi> yet the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Embaſſador, who was then Reſident
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:59609:125"/>there aſſur'd me; that the Guns were not only heard thither, but that his Chamber Windows were conſiderably ſhaken. And ſome Bodies are ſo apt to receive Impreſſions from the undu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating Motion of the Air, as to be ſenſibly, tho' not viſibly affected; of which <hi>Simon Pauli</hi> in his ingenious Tract <hi>De Febribus Malignis</hi> p. 71. gives an Inſtance in theſe Words. <hi>Atqui aeger ille Gallus brachio truncatus, octiduum quidem ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfuit, ſed horrendis totius corporis Convulſionibus correptus; qui quoque (ut &amp; illa addam Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one digniſſima,) dum in Domini ſui aedibus ad pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>team</hi> Kiodmoggerianum, Romanè, Laniorum <hi>appellares, decumberet, ac me ac aliis aliquandiu ad Lectum illius conſidentibus quidem, ſed nobis non attendentibus, explodentur tormenta bellica ex Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giis ac Praetoriis Navibus, ſiniſtra truncum dextrâ brachii fovens ac complectens, toties quoties explode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentur ſingula exclamabat au, au, me miſerum!

                        <p>But leſt in the aforemention'd Inſtances it ſhould be alledg'd, that theſe Sounds are rather propagated by the Earth, which the Bodies which receiv'd the firſt Impreſſion leaned upon,

                        <p>But theſe Effects will not be thought ſtrange, if we reflect on what hath been obſerv'd to be produc'd by the Celerity of the Motion of the minute Parts of a Body; eſpecially if we like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe conſider, that Sounds are propagated with greater Celerity than any thing we know be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, in our Sphere. For tho', as <hi>Marſennus</hi> takes Notice, a Bullet moves 240 Yards in the ſixth Part of a Minute; yet I have obſerv'd Sounds to move 400 Yards in the ſame ſpace of time. But tho' (it being granted that Sounds may be conveigh'd through the Air,) the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of Houſes or Ships at Sea might be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to ariſe from the Impetuous Motion of the Medium, violently ſhaken by an intenſe Agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where thoſe Sounds were originally form'd; yet I conceive the Effects which thoſe Sounds have on Bodies which are plac'd upon the Surface of this Globe, depend in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure on the Diſpoſitions of thoſe Bodies to be work'd upon by ſuch.</p>

                        <p>The Effects of ſome ſubtle Parts of Matter are uſually eſteem'd very inconſiderable, by thoſe who imagine, that theſe more ſubtle Effluvia of Bodies only Act upon the exteral Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of others: But if we conſider, that thoſe Effluvia are not only very Numerous, but of convenient Figures and Sizes to penetrate into the inmoſt receſſes of Bodies they work upon, we may attribute more powerful Effects to them than Men uſually are wont to do; for as the Motion of the Effluvia are more or leſs ſtrong, and numerous, they may either disjoyn or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe alter the Textures of thoſe Bodies. As in an Ant-hill, whoſe Soyl is full of Eggs, by the Number and Motion of thoſe little Inſects; the Eggs which are up and down interſpers'd betwixt the Parts of the Earth, will preſently be ſeparated and diſplac'd; or as the Leaves and
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:59609:127"/>Boughs of a Tree are variouſly bent and broken off, by the force of the Inviſible Parts of the Air which paſſes through it.</p>
                        <p>But to come to Inſtances which may more Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate what we are about; That the ſubtile Parts of Matter whoſe effects are leſs taken No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, are enabled, by their Size and Figure, to disjoyn the Parts of Bodies they work upon; we have an evident Inſtance in Sugar, and Amber thrown together into Water; for the Water preſently divides the Parts of the Sugar, and totally diſſolves them; whereas the Amber con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues unaltred. To which Inſtance may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded one of no leſs Force, afforded by Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry; for if you pour limpid Water, upon that conſiſtent Subſtance, which remains after an abſtraction of five Parts of Oyl of Vitriol from one of Mercury, and ſhake the Mixture, the Calx will preſently exchange it's White for a Limon-colour, the Texture of the whole Maſs being preſently alter'd,</p>
                        <p>And how powerful the minute Parts of ſome Bodies are, we may further obſerve in Spirit of Wine: For if a Piece of Metal be held in the Flame of it, theſe ſubtil Particles preſently pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate the Subſtance of that Solid Body; and ſo exagitate the Parts of it, as to put them into a Motion ſtrong enough to Cauſe a ſenſible Heat.

                        </head>
                        <p>IT is uſually thought, becauſe ſome Bodies when they ſtrike againſt Solid ones, commonly fly back, That the Impulſe of that Body is not able to put the other into Motion; but that the Parts of a Solid may be put into Motion, and that that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be propagated through ſuch Conſiſtent Subſtances, is evident, if we ſtrike a piece of Timber ſlightly upon one End: For by that means, the Motion caus'd by that Impreſſion, will be carry'd on to the other. And I have by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience found, that having drawn the Point of a Pin upon the Brim of an Hemiſpherical Veſſel,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:59609:128"/>which was made of Bell-Metal, which is much harder than Steel, I found it, from a very ſlight Impreſſion, to produce ſuch a laſting Sound, as was an Argument, that the Parts of the Metal were not only put into ſuch a Vibrating Motion, as to communicate it to the Air, but to continue it ſucceſſively round the Brim of the Veſſel, till the Sound ceas'd. And the like Propagation of Sounds I found to ſucceed, tho' the Point of a Pin were but ſtruck upon that Veſſel, which was ſeven Inches in Diameter. And indeed the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagable Motion of Solids, when they are acted on by Fluids, is not leſs remarkable; ſince the Parts of a Bar of <hi>Iron,</hi> or <hi>Glaſs,</hi> may be put into ſuch a Motion by Heat, as to have it continu'd to ſome Diſtance from the place where the Fire firſt work'd upon them, tho' it be capable of being propagated much further in the former of the two; which ſhews how much the Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Bodies diſpoſe them to be differently work'd upon by the ſame Agent; and how much a Convenient Texture diſpoſes them to be work'd upon at all.</p>
                        <p>And it may be further obſerv'd, That it is look'd upon as a Sign of the firm Connection of a Houſe, that upon the Clapping of a Door, the whole ſhakes; and it is likewiſe an Argument of the Communicableneſs of Motion, whether it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the mutual Contact of the Door, and the Poſts it ſhuts againſt, or upon the Impreſſion made upon the included Air by the Door; for the former ſhews how a Solid may propagate Motion amongſt Solids; and the Latter, how it may give Motion to a Fluid, and <hi>Vice versâ.</hi>

                        <pb n="222" facs="tcp:59609:129"/>
                        <p>But further, it is aſſerted by <hi>Seneca,</hi> that upon the Exploſion of thoſe Subterraneali Exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are the Cauſes of Earth-quakes, the Tremulous Motion of the Earth is continu'd above two hundred Miles: And <hi>Joſephus Acoſta</hi> witneſſeth, That it hath been continu'd for three hundred Leagues in the Kingdom of <hi>Peru:</hi> And Learned Writers in the beginning of our Age (1601) witneſs, that the Motion of the Earth was ſo violent, as to ſhake moſt part of <hi>Europe,</hi> being propagated through moſt part of <hi>Aſia, Hungary, Germany, Italy,</hi> and <hi>France:</hi> And I have frequently obſerv'd, That the Houſe I have been in, hath ſenſibly ſhook, by the Tremulous Motion of the Earth it ſtood upon, propagated from ſome Coach or Cart, which mov'd at ſome diſtance upon the Ground; and ſome obſerving Scouts ſay, That, by the Motion of the Earth, they can diſcover the Approach of a Troop of Horſe at a good Diſtance.</p>
                        <p>And, to conclude this Member of our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, if ſuch Diſproportionate Cauſes, can produce ſuch Effects in Inorganical Bodies, well may they in thoſe that are Organical, where there is only wanting a ſmall Cauſe to call in the Aſſiſtance, and to determine the Cooperation of others; as the Tickling of a Feather in the Noſe, by Determining the Tendency of the Spirits, Cauſes Sneezing: And I remember, being once held with ſuch a Diſtemper, as depriv'd me of the uſe of my Hands; If, in the <hi>Summer,</hi> a Hair were but blown upon my Face, and continued there long, it would put me into Convulſions and cauſe me to faint.</p>

And I have often felt not only the ſtriking of a Watch included in a double Caſe, when I have worn it in my Pocket, but even the gentler Motions of the Ballances.</p>
                        <p>To the Foregoing Inſtances, I ſhall add, That upon ſudden Claps of Thunder, the very Beds have been perceiv'd to ſhake, by thoſe that lay upon them: And <hi>Agricola, de Nat. eorum quae fluunt è terra, Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. ſays, <hi>Si Animal deijicitur in Antrum, quod est in</hi> Carelia, <hi>Regione</hi> Scandiae, <hi>erumpit, ut perhibent, ſonus intolerabilis magno cum flatu: Si leve pondus in Specum</hi> Dalma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae, <hi>quamvis, inquit</hi> Plinius, <hi>tranquillo die, turbini ſimilis emicat procella.</hi>

                        <p>But there are ſtill ſome who are unwilling to believe, That Motion is propagable through Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid Bodies; at leaſt to any conſiderable Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, becauſe of the eaſy Ceſſion of their Parts: But the contrary eaſily appears, if we allow of the Corpuſcular Notion of Light; by Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not only how far the Rays of Light are
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:59609:130"/>impell'd, and propagated from a ſmall Light, but from the fix'd Stars, which are plac'd at ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe a Diſtance.</p>
                        <p>But to proceed to Inſtances, not ſo liable to Objections, that the Parts of Liquids, tho' in Motion, and Separate one from another, may communicate Motion, and propagate it a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable way, is evident, by caſting a Stone into the Water; which, by that Impulſe, will ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively propagate Motion in the Maſs of Water; which appears by the Curling and Circular Streams which flow from it: And I am told by one who was us'd to Fiſh for <hi>Whales,</hi> near <hi>Green-Land,</hi> that ſometimes, upon the Thawing of the Ice, it would give ſuch Cracks, as to cauſe Sounds much lowder than Claps of Thunder; and when huge pieces of Ice upon a Thaw, fell into the Sea, they caus'd ſuch a Diſturbance in it, as at two Leagues Diſtance to raiſe a conſiderable Storm.</p>
                        <p>And tho' ſome People are apt to think, That, the Air, being a Body much more Fluid than Water, Motion is leſs propagable in it; I ſhall intimate, that even in that <hi>Medium,</hi> a very ſmall Sound is propagated, much further than we think of; for tho' we are not able to take Notice of it, beyond the Place where we ſtand, yet we may learn from <hi>Ecchos,</hi> that the Undulating Motion of the Air is continu'd a good way further; and it is not improbable, that it is continu'd further than the Place where the <hi>Eccho</hi> is made; ſince the Learned <hi>Fromundus,</hi> Profeſſor of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> at <hi>Lovain,</hi> in the Year 1627, ſays, That at the Siege of <hi>Oſtend,</hi> the Noiſe of the Cannon was heard an hundred and twenty <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miles.

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:59609:131"/>the <hi>Air</hi> may be put into a Motion ſo powerful, either by the Vibration of the Strings, or the Mechanical Form of a <hi>Muſical</hi> Inſtrument, or Scraping the Edge of a Knife upon Metal, as, to cauſe an Involuntary Excretion of Urine upon a Body rightly diſpos'd, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to a Knight of <hi>Gaſcony;</hi> or, to cauſe that Effect which is uſually term'd, Setting the Teeth on Edge.</p>

                        <p>That the Peculiar Modifications and Relations which Bodies have to each other, upon that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, may contribute much to the Effects which the Languid Motions of the Air produce; and that upon that ſcore, a weak Motion of it, may cauſe more conſiderable Effects, than Louder Sounds, not ſo aptly modify'd; I ſhall produce ſeveral
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:59609:132"/>Inſtances: For not to urge, That the String of an Inſtrument may be made to Vibrate it ſelf, by the Motion it receives from the Inſtrument, and which that Inſtrument firſt receiv'd from another String, I ſhall rather offer the following In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; <hi>viz.</hi> That a Strong Wire being made uſe of amongſt other Strings on a <hi>Muſical</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, it was obſerv'd, that the Wire would be made to tremble, by the Impulſe of the Air, caus'd by a Sound which was made at a Diſtance, tho' the other Strings were not ſenſibly affected; but in this <hi>Experiment</hi> it is to be noted, That a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar degree of <hi>Tenſion</hi> is requiſite, to afford the Foremention'd <hi>Phaenomenon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To this <hi>Experiment</hi> it may be added, That I have not only obſerv'd, that by making a Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Sound at ſome Diſtance from an <hi>Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpherical</hi>-Glaſs, it would ſenſibly ring; but I have likewiſe taken Notice, That having ſcrew'd ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Strings of a <hi>Muſical</hi> Inſtrument to a different Degree of <hi>Tenſion,</hi> and likewiſe plac'd ſeveral Glaſſes at ſome Diſtance, thoſe Strings being put into a ſtrong Degree of <hi>Tenſion,</hi> would cauſe one Glaſs to ring without affecting the other; and if the <hi>Tenſion</hi> of that String was alter'd, it would affect another Glaſs, but not the ſame: And what is more Remarkable, is, That tho' a String wound up to a Determinate Degree of <hi>Tenſion,</hi> would affect ſuch a Glaſs; yet if the Foot of the ſame Glaſs were a little broke, it would not till it's <hi>Tenſion</hi> was alter'd.</p>
                        <p>And I have taken notice, That upon the Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome Stops in an Organ, the Sound hath been ſo conſiderable, as not only to cauſe the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganist</hi>'s Seat to tremble, but a Seat in the Church,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:59609:132"/>which was at a conſiderable Diſtance; and I could eaſily diſcern with my Fingers, that the Sound not only caus'd the Seat, but the Borders of my Hat to tremble: Which Inſtances ſhew, that the Effects of that Sound are not ſo much to be attributed to the Violence of it, as to the Diſpoſitions in ſuch Bodies to be acted on by it.</p>
                        <p>And to prove, That Languid Motion may have conſiderable Effects upon Bodies, both So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and of conſiderable Bulk, I ſhall bring the following Inſtances: The Firſt is, That an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Muſician</hi> affirm'd to me, that playing upon a Baſſe-Viol, he found, that when he ſtruck a certain Note, it had always ſuch an Effect upon a Caſement, in the Room where he play'd to one of his Scholars, as to cauſe a Jarring Noiſe. A Second Inſtance is, That I obſerv'd in a certain Vault, that tho' a <hi>Muſician</hi> vary'd his Notes on purpoſe, to make Tryal whether they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound in the Arch, it would anſwer to but one Note; and I am told, that there is the like pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity in moſt Vaults.</p>

                        <p>Tho' the External Superficies of a Body, ſeems to argue, That it's Parts are at Reſt, ſince it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains it's Proper Figure and Dimenſions; yet it is not improbable, but that thoſe Corpuſcles which compoſe it, are variouſly mov'd amongſt themſelves, or in a Tendency to Motion; An Inſtance of the Firſt of which, we have in heated <hi>Iron,</hi> whether made hot by Actual Fire, or Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering:
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:59609:133"/>For tho' the Eye can diſcern no Motion at all amongſt it's Parts, yet the Touch perceives it manifeſtly hot: And tho' the Lath of a Croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, or the String of a Bow, be look'd upon, when bent, as Bodies at Reſt, yet the Springi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the former, and violent Separation of the Ends of the Latter, when cut, manifeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates, that they were only in a ſtate of <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:</hi> To which might be added ſeveral Inſtances, taken as well from <hi>Nature</hi> as <hi>Art.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Of the Latter ſort I have obſerv'd, That amongſt Glaſſes, which to all appearance were well bak'd, ſeveral Months after they were made. ſome of them flew in pieces of their own accord, which they ſcarce ever fail to do, if they be taken from the Fire, and ſuffer'd to cool ſuddenly. The like to which I have obſerv'd, in a Metalline Glaſs of my own Preparation, which would ſhrink ſo much when remov'd from the Fire, as, if ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly cool'd, to fly in pieces.</p>
                        <p>And if a piece of Copper heated to a Redneſs, or a Whiteneſs, be, upon Cooling, held over a piece of Paper, ſeveral Fleaks will preſently fly off it; which ſeem to be Vitrify'd Metal, which, upon their ſhrinking, when expos'd to cool, fly aſunder, like the Strings of a <hi>Muſical</hi> Inſtrument in moiſt Weather.</p>
                        <p>And upon this Occaſion, to ſhew how much Metals may ſhrink, I ſhall add, That I have found, that tho' a piece of <hi>Iron,</hi> when hot, would not go into a Cavity made in a Metalline Body for that purpoſe; yet when expos'd to the Air, and cool'd, it would ſhrink ſo much, as to be able to enter it: And to this, I ſhall add two Notable Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, That a certain <hi>Artificer,</hi> having
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:59609:133"/>caſt a number of Metalline Concaves, found, that tho' he took care to keep them from being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the Air, whilſt cooling, and tho' they were of a conſiderable Thickneſs, and much har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than <hi>Iron;</hi> yet when they were leaſurely cool'd to a certain degree, they would crack with a great Noiſe. The Second Obſervation is, That an Expert <hi>Artist,</hi> having caſt a quantity of Bell-metal, and permitted it to cool about 12 Hours, upon the Area of an <hi>Iron</hi> Inſtrument, he found it conſiderably ſhrunk from the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and crack'd in ſeveral places: And the like Accident hath happen'd in <hi>Braſs:</hi> for an <hi>Artist</hi> aſſur'd me, That having caſt a Ring of <hi>Braſe,</hi> about a Cylinder of <hi>Iron,</hi> upon cooling, it was ſo much ſhrunk, as to leave a Crack quite through on one Side.</p>
                        <p>From which <hi>Experiments</hi> it ſeems reaſonable to infer, That a Body may be brought to a ſtate of <hi>Tenſion,</hi> as well by being expanded by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Force of the Fire, as any other external Agents; and alſo, That the Preter-natural ſtates of Bodies, which they are brought into by ſome Agents, are to be look'd upon to depend on their Previous Diſpoſitions, ſince tho' the Moiſture of the Air will not cauſe a String of an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to crack, which is moderately wound up, yet if it's <hi>Tenſion</hi> be much ſtronger, it preſently flies in pieces: So likewiſe, if a Piece of Glaſs be hot in one Part, and cool in another, tho' cold Water dropp'd upon the hot Glaſs, will crack it, yet it will not have the ſame Effect on the Cool part of the Glaſs.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>To prove this Propoſition, I ſhall offer the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Experiments:</hi> And Firſt, Having turn'd a <hi>Key</hi> in a <hi>Braſs</hi> ſtop Cock, a conſiderable time, till the Metal, by frequent Attritions, became hot; I obſerv'd it at the laſt ſo to ſwell, as to ſtick faſt like a Wedge, ſo that it could not be mov'd, till the Metal was again cool: And an Experienc'd <hi>Workman</hi> hath inform'd me, that in making ſuch <hi>Inſtruments,</hi> before the <hi>Key</hi> could rightly be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apted to the Cavity it was to fit, he was forc'd to cool it ſeveral times in Water, to take down the Expanſion effected by the Heat.</p>
                        <p>To this <hi>Experiment,</hi> it may be added, That the Parts of a Drinking-Glaſs, will be put into Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:59609:136"/>by drawing One's Finger round the Brim; and that ſo violent, as to toſs ſeveral Drops of the Water contain'd in it, a conſiderable height into the Air; and a Drinking-Glaſs Artificially cut by a ſpiral Line, being dextrouſly inverted and ſhaken, will have its Parts ſo manifeſtly vibrated up and down, as to acquire a quarter of an Inch in Length, without any evident injury to the Glaſs. And it hath been obſerv'd, by one who made uſe of harden'd <hi>Steel</hi> Inſtruments to turn <hi>Iron,</hi> and ſhake off the Protuberances of that Metal; that in a little time it would acquire ſuch a Heat and ſo loſe it's Temper, as to look blue or yellowiſh, if it was not timely dipt in a convenient Liquor, to keep it cool. To this I ſhall add, That having two or three times bent a Bar of <hi>Tin</hi> in my Hands, backwards and forwards, I found, upon the Breaking of it, that the internal parts had acquir'd a conſiderable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Heat.</p>
                        <p>From which <hi>Experiment</hi> it appears, that Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Parts, without a manifeſt Percuſſion, is able to cauſe a ſenſible Heat; and that not only hard, but ſoft Bodies, may do ſo too, I ſhall add the following <hi>Experiments,</hi> to evince, which is that an <hi>Artist</hi> having only rubb'd Optick-Glaſſes with <hi>Putree,</hi> upon a piece of Leather, to poliſh them, told me, that they acquir'd ſuch a degree of Heat, as ſometimes to crack; tho' I am not unapt to think, that ſuch an Effect might as well be attributed to a peculiar Motion of the Parts of Glaſs, which were too violent; ſince from the aforemention'd Vibration of the Parts of a Drinking-Glaſs, it appears, That they may
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:59609:137"/>be put into a conſiderable degree of Motion, without Heat: And that, by a very eaſy Friction, ſuch Bodies may acquire a Tremulous Motion, appears from the following <hi>Experiment, viz.</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuffer'd melted Brimſtone to cool, in a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel whoſe Cavity was concave, I rubb'd the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex Superficies of the Brimſtone, upon a Cuſhion for ſome time, and found, by applying my Ear to it, that the Parts of the Brimſtone were put into ſuch a Vibrating Motion, as to continue a crackling Noiſe for ſome time, after the Friction was diſcontinu'd. To which I ſhall add, That ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving rubb'd two Stones taken out of the Bladder together, I found them to yield a ſtrong Urinous Smell: And not only Sulphur will emit Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous Steams, by rubbing it upon Cloth, but <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds</hi> themſelves will acquire a conſiderable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Electricity;</hi> and I have one by me, which, if rubb'd, will appear Luminous in the Dark.</p>
                        <p>And that it may further appear, that a peculiar Modification of Motion, may contribute to the various Effects produc'd by it, I ſhall obſerve, That thoſe Stones which <hi>Italian</hi> Glaſs-men make uſe of, afford Sparks of Fire by Colliſion; but if moderately rubb'd together, they emit <hi>faetid</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations; from whence probably proceed thoſe offenſive Steams, emitted by Glaſs; and what is moſt remarkable, and to our purpoſe is, tho' Glaſs when Red-hot emits no ſuch <hi>Effluvia;</hi> yet if two pieces be dexterouſly rubb'd together, they will ſend forth Steams copious enough and <hi>faetid.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And to ſhew how brisk the Motions of the Parts of inorganical Bodies are, and how ſoon they communicate Motion to one another, we need
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:59609:137"/>but conſider, how the Tremulous Motion of a <hi>Bell</hi> is continu'd ſucceſſively round it; and how, all that time, it communicates that Motion to the Air about it; for that the Parts of it are ſo ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept in Motion, appears from that Trembling Motion, which may be perceiv'd by one's Finger: And it is further confirm'd, becauſe a Solution of the Continuity much deadens, and cauſes the Sound to be much ſhorter: And that the Air receives its Undulating Motion from the Impreſs of the <hi>Bell</hi> all that time, appears, if One's Finger, or ſome other Body be apply'd to it, which ſtops that Tremulous Motion. And that the Motions in the Parts of the <hi>Bell</hi> are very brisk, is evinc'd from what is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm'd, <hi>viz.</hi> That if a String be ty'd about a <hi>Bell,</hi> ſo as to check the Tremulous Motion upon the ſtriking of the Clapper, it would break, ſome Parts being more agitated than others; ſo that the Diſproportionate Motion compar'd with the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the other Parts ſurmounting their Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they muſt conſequently fly aſunder: And,</p>
                        <p>As a further Argument, that the Parts of the <hi>Bell</hi> are ſo agitated, I put Filings of <hi>Steel,</hi> and Drops of Water into a <hi>Hand-Bell,</hi> and obſerved, That, upon the Impulſe of a <hi>Key,</hi> the Water ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, and the Filings had likewiſe ſuch a Motion given to their Parts, as enabled them to dance up and down.</p>
                        <p>But to put an end to theſe Obſervations, I ſhall only intimate, That from what hath been ſaid, it may appear, what conſiderable Effects may be caus'd by the Unheeded Motions of Inviſible Parts of Matter, which are wont to be aſcribed to other leſs Intelligible Cauſes.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>TO illuſtrate what hath been deliver'd in the former Chapter, I ſhall add the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Obſervations: And Firſt, That the Motion of the Air may act on Bodies duly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpos'd, at a great Diſtance, appears from what the Learned <hi>Borellus De vi Percuſſionis, Prop. CXI.</hi> relates, <hi>viz.</hi> That being at <hi>Tauromenium</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> about thirty Miles from Mount <hi>Aetna,</hi> when it firſt broke out, it was obſervable, that the Houſes in that Town apparently ſhook, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe which were moſt directly ſituated towards the Gap; which, as that Author ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, muſt needs proceed from the Impreſſion of the Air upon the Houſes: for had it been the Effect of a Tremulous Motion in the Ground, all the Houſes would have ſhook alike, which was otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>To prove that Motion may be propagated through different <hi>Mediums,</hi> beſides what hath been before deliver'd, I ſhall add, That the Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <hi>Famianus Strada, De Bello Belg. Dec.</hi> 2. <hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>vel</hi> 7. ſays, That a very Stupendious Work being rais'd by the <hi>Prince of Parma,</hi> to prevent the City of <hi>Antwerp</hi> from being reliev'd by the River <hi>Scheld,</hi> an <hi>Engineer</hi> contriv'd to blow it up, tho' with Succeſs not a little Tragical, by a Boat fraught with Gun-powder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for it rais'd ſuch a Commotion, that the Earth ſhook to the Diſtance of 36 <hi>Engliſh Miles;</hi> and the deep Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:59609:138"/>was ſo agitated, as firſt to diſcover it's Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and afterwards to overſwell the Banks; the Caſtle, together with Men, Cannons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing violently toſs'd into the Air, together with a vaſt number of other Accidents horrid and dreadful.</p>
                     <p>And to illuſtrate further what hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd in the foregoing Chapter, concerning the Effects of <hi>Muſick</hi> on Bodies duly diſpos'd to be work'd on by it; I ſhall add, that an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd Traveller told me, That in the <hi>East Indies</hi> he ſaw Tame <hi>Serpents,</hi> which would raiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves erect in the Air, except 3 or 4 Inches of their Tails, which they reſted upon: And he added, That upon the Playing of ſome Parts of the Tune, they would be put into very brisk and ſurpriſing Motions, whereas when another Part of it was a-playing, they ſeem'd to be half a ſleep, and diſſolv'd in Pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>Another Inſtance, which ſhews how much the Peculiar Textures of Bodies contribute to their Effects, is publiſh'd by the Learned <hi>Marhofius,</hi> who relates, That <hi>Nicolaus Petterus</hi> had found out a Note, which, being loud and laſting, would, without viſibly touching the Veſſel, cauſe a Glaſs-Romer to tremble and burſt; but if the Note were rais'd either too high, or depreſs'd too low, it would have no ſuch Effect.</p>
                     <p>A further Inſtance of the Efficacy of <hi>Languid Motion</hi> is, That I once obtain'd ſeveral pieces of Glaſs, the Textures of which were ſo peculiar, that if the internal Superficies were gently ſcratch'd obliquely with a Pin, they would fly in pieces, tho' 6 or 7 times thicker than common Drinking-glaſſes.</p>
                     <pb n="238" facs="tcp:59609:139"/>
                     <p>To ſhew how much <hi>Motion,</hi> even in Solid Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, may be promoted by the Strokes of very weak Agents, I ſhall here relate, that ſeveral Urinals whoſe Parts were of a peculiar Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, being rubb'd with Sand and Water, had their Parts put into ſuch a Degree of Motion, as, in a little time after, to break without any Cauſe to be obſerv'd, except that precedent At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition of Sand.</p>
                     <p>To make it evident, that the Parts of Solid Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which ſeem to be at Reſt, may have very powerful Effects, I ſhall add the following. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That I have been inform'd, by a Famous <hi>Jeweller,</hi> That when he ground <hi>Rubies</hi> or <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phires,</hi> or other Precious Stones upon a Mill, their Parts would acquire ſuch a degree of Heat, as to afford Light like Fire; the Light flowing from each being of the ſame Colour with the Gem it came from: And I am likewiſe inform'd by ano<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther, that when they have acquir'd a certain degree of Heat, the Edges would gape; and if the Motion of the Mill was continu'd, the Gems would fly in pieces; but if it was ſtopp'd, the cold Gem would be whole and entire. To this <hi>Obſervation</hi> it will not be amiſs to add, That, I once plac'd a Bottle, to which was adapted a Glaſs-ſtopple, in my Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and about a twelve Month after, as I was ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the Room, the Top of the Stopple flew off, of its own accord, leaving the other Part faſt in the Glaſs; but the Parts of Solid Glaſs will not only fly in pieces of their own accord, but I have been inform'd, that ſometimes, in the <hi>East-Indies; Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds</hi> themſelves, are obſerv'd to burſt aſunder, without the Impreſſion of any Viſible Agent.</p>

                     <p>This I have already hinted in the foregoing Chapters of Forms and Qualities; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my deſign in this Chapter, is, to conſider what Qualities a Body may Aquire, by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions or Influence of Agents whoſe Effects are unknown, or not taken notice of.</p>
                     <p>And though all theſe <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> which are uſually attributed to the Laws of Nature, might properly be conſidered, in a Chapter that bears this Title; yet ſince thoſe Agents moſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Effecting of theſe <hi>Phaenomena</hi> are either the Stars, the ſubterraneal Parts, or the Aether and Atmoſphaere we live in; I ſhall wave thoſe, and only here conſider, what is requiſite to prove, that there are ſuch real Qualities, depending on unheeded Agents, and the Ordinary Courſe of Nature;<note place="margin">Our Notion of Coſmical Qualities grounded on the three following Propoſitions</note> but before I proceed, I ſhall briefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, that our Notion of Coſmical Qualities is grounded upon theſe three Propoſitions.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. That ſome Bodies are altogether inactive, till they are acted on; and that others, are put into Action, chiefly by the Influence of theſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick and unheeded Agents.</item>
                        <pb n="241" facs="tcp:59609:140"/>
                        <item>2. That there are ſeveral Bodies, which when put into Action, are ſubtle enough to inſinuate themſelves into the Pores of other Bodies, which they are by the Eſtabliſhed Laws of Nature for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to act on.</item>
                        <item>3. That an Alteration of the Mechanical Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Body, is enough to diſpoſe it, or ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it unapt to be worked on, by thoſe unheeded Agents. And theſe three Propoſitions I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make out by the following <hi>Phaenomena</hi> and Experiments.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>To begin then with the firſt Propoſition, <hi>viz. That ſome Bodies are altogether inactive, till they are acted on; and that others are put into Action,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Propoſition the firſt.</note> 
                        <hi>chiefly by the Influence of theſe Catholick and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nheed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Agents.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt Part of this Propoſition, I preſume undeniable, if we conſider, That till a Hammer, or ſome other Body be ſtruck upon a Wedge, it wants the Power or Faculty of cleaving Wood, but when forced by the Impulſe of that Body, which ſtrikes upon it, the Wedge preſently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuates it ſelf betwixt the Parts of that Solid, and divides them; As alſo, that a Knife is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unable to attract a Needle, till it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that Power from a Loadſtone.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed to the ſecond Part of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; I ſhall, to what I have elſewhere ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved (<hi>viz.</hi> That the Property of a Burning-Glaſs, in reſpect of it's Effects, does not proceed from the Convex Figure, conſidered as ſuch, but the Rays of the Sun caſt into a Point) add the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing

But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The ſecond Propoſition.</note>The ſecond Propoſition; which is, <hi>That there are ſeveral Bodies, which, when put into Action, are ſubtle enough, to inſinuate themſelves into the Pores of other Bodies, which they are, by the Eſtabliſhed Laws of Nature, forced to Act on.</hi> And here, though ſome of the Experiments to be related, might be alſo alledged in favour of that <hi>Aether</hi> or <hi>Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria coeleſtis,</hi> which ſome Philoſophers have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be diſperſed throughout the World; yet the Inviſible Agents, which are here to be mentioned, are only ſuch as the Magnetical Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvia of the Earth, and alſo the Air, in reference to it's Spring and Weight.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, Tho a Bar of Silver, and another of Steel, be expoſed to cool, when red hot, with their ends directly North and South; yet the Textures of theſe two Metals being different one
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:59609:142"/>from another, the Pores of the Steel, being ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the Metal made plyable, it is by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuation of Terreſtrial Effluvia, endued with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Magnetical Qualities; and particularly, when poiſed, to point North and South; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Silver acquires no ſuch Properties. And that it may be leſs ſtrange, that the Earth ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford Magnetical Effluvia, which are imagined by ſome to be very ſpirituous Ones, I ſhall add, that having heated an Oblong Loadſtone, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it to the Air to cool, with it's Ends pointing North and South, and ſo deprived it of it's Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netical Qualities; I could make either End to tend to the Southern or Northern Pole, as, upon Ignition, I ſuffered it to cool with one end dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted either North or Southwards.</p>
                     <p>To this it may be added, That if the Air be exhauſted in ſome meaſure out of a Vial with an oblong Neck, and, upon it's Immerſion in Water, ones Finger, which prevented the retroadmiſſion of the Air, be preſently taken away; the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will contrary to the Tendency of it's own Gravity, preſently fly up in the Bottle, being ſqueezed in by the External Preſſure of the Air, lying upon the Surface of the Water, the Spring of the Internal Air, being ſo weakned, as not to be able to oppoſe the force of it; whereas in a <hi>Vacuo</hi> the Water would not be ſo raiſed, having no external Agent to boye it up.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive force of Beans ſoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with Water.</note>Again, being deſirous to know the Cauſes of Germination, and from what Cauſes, that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Intumeſcence of Seeds, when ſown, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I filled ſeveral Veſſels of Glaſs, as well as Earth, with common Beans, filling up the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals with Water, and tying the Corks faſt with
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:59609:143"/>Strings; which being done, when the Beans had imbibed Water enough, their Intumeſcence was ſo powerful, as not only to break ſeveral of the Veſſels, but a great many of the Strings which hindred the raiſing of the Corks. But that I might be more exact in eſtimating the Power of that Expanſive Force, I put a ſufficient Quantity of Beans and Water into a Braſs Cylinder, whoſe Diameter was two Inches, and it's Length ſix; which being done, and the Orifice of the Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der being likewiſe fitted exactly with a Plug, a Trencher was placed upon it, which was broad enough to bear a half hundred weight of Lead: In which Experiment it was to be obſerved, that in two or three days, the Expanſive Force of the Beans had raiſed the Plug a conſiderable Height. And it may further be noted in ſuch Tryals, that as the Diameter of the Cylinder is larger, ſo the Expanſive Force of the Beans are able to raiſe a more conſiderable Weight.</p>
                     <p>How far theſe Experiments may confirm the Corpuſcularian Philoſophy, or whether that Force may be Mechanically explained by it, I ſhall leave the Reader to conſider, and ſhall here only obſerve, That the Air, together with the <hi>Aether,</hi> may in a great Meaſure concur to the producing of ſome of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, which we imagin it very little concerned in; for beſides the Effects which may be aſcribed to the Preſſure of the Air, it contributes to the producing of ſome upon another Account; it being eaſy to be obſerved, that Fleſh may be preſerved lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from Putrefaction, by being ſecluded from the Contact and Influence of the Air; and alſo, that the Light which flows from rotten Woods,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:59609:143"/>and ſome putrefyed Fiſhes, will appear and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear upon the Contact or Separation of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Air.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Several <hi>Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> produc'd by Virtue of Motion in the Parts of the Air.</note>But for a further Proof, that the Air may ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſeveral things, beſides what it produces by virtue of it's weight by the Inſenſible Motions of it's Parts; I might add, that whereas a Piece of Paper being wet with Oyl, hath it's Pores ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, as to be capable of tranſmitting more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily the Rays of Light; and the Air being impelled, by the Laws of Nature, preſently acts upon it, and repreſents a great many Objects, by being reflected from thoſe Bodies beyond it, which could not appear through it before.</p>
                     <p>And if a large Box be ſo contrived, as to have one end of it open, and a Hole in the other end, covered with a Lenticular Glaſs; if the open end be made up with a fine ſheet of Paper, and a ſmall Hole be likewiſe made upon the Top of the Box; by placing ones Eye to the Lenticular Glaſs, one may diſcern upon the Paper the Lively Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of External Objects, and their vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Motions as well as Shape and Colours; which <hi>Phaenomena</hi> could by no means be exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, were not either ſome Inſenſible Corpuſcles, tranſmitted in the Form of Effluvia from thoſe Objects, or ſome other ſubtle Particles of Matter, directed by Local Motion from the Object to the Paper, and from thence to the Eyes.</p>

                        </note>From whence it appears, that the Eſtabliſhed Laws of the Univerſe, in a great meaſure, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the producing of ſeveral <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> which ariſe from the Operations of inſenſible and unheeded Cauſes: For a further Confirmation of which I ſhall add, That if a Bar of Iron be held
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:59609:144"/>in a perpendicular Line; ſo that the lower end of it touch the Northren Point of a Magnetical Needle, it will preſently drive it away; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, if the Poſition of that Iron Bar be ſo altered, as to touch that Point with the other end, it will, by a contrary Faculty, attract it, except the Iron Bar hath ſtood a conſiderable time in a Perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Poſture, expoſed to the Air and the Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Effluvia of the Earth, or hath lain a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time, pointing North and South, and ſo hath acquired a more durable Verticity. And if it ſhould be asked;<note place="margin">How a Bar of Iron ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netical Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</hi>
                        </note> why, by ſuch Poſtures, the Magnetical Qualities of Iron ſhould be ſo much increaſed? it might probably be anſwered, that it proceeded from hence, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe the Pores of the Iron, by lying nearer the Magnetical Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via of the Earth, have their Pores rendred more apt to receive and tranſmit the Effluvia of the Needle; ſo that conſequently, that Part of the Iron which is moſt affected by thoſe Steams, muſt become the ſtronger, and conſequently the North Point of the Needle; for which reaſon, it muſt drive away the North Point of the Needle, and attract the South. But if on the contrary, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end of the Bar be applyed to the Needle, by a contrary reaſon, it being leſs Magnetical, it muſt attract it. But not to inſiſt upon this Explanation of the Magnetical Qualities of a Bar of Iron, I ſhall only obſerve, that it is neceſſary in order to acquire a durable Magnetical Virtue, that the Iron ſhould ſtand long in that Perpendicular Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, which is ſufficient to prove what I contend for, <hi>viz.</hi> That the eſtabliſhed Laws of Nature are requiſite for the Production of ſeveral <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena,</hi> which would not be effected, were not thoſe Laws obſerv'd.</p>
                     <pb n="247" facs="tcp:59609:144"/>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Third <hi>Propoſition.</hi>
                        </note>But to proceed to the third and laſt Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, <hi>viz. That an Alteration of the Mechanical Texture of a Body is enough to diſpoſe it or render it unapt to be work'd on by thoſe unheeded Agents.</hi> This is evident from what is practis'd at Sea, it being the uſual Cuſtom for the Sea-men, to throw Water upon their Sails to quicken the Motion of their Veſſels, when purſu'd by Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates; for the Threeds of the Sails being ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Water, and the Pores by that Means made leſs, the Wind, not finding ſo free a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage through them, muſt conſequently have the greater Force upon the Sail-Clothes, and ſo drive the Ship forwards more ſwiftly. Another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of conſiderable Effects ſucceeding a very ſlight Alteration in Texture may be obſerved, when, on a windy day, a Chamber-Window is left open; for the Wind, which before only ſhook the Glaſs, will preſently blow the Curtains about and other things in the Chamber, which are in a Diſpoſition to be eaſily moved, as Duſt, Papers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to proceed to Examples altogether not ſo groſs, we may take notice, That though com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Tartar will neither diſſolve in the Air, nor eaſily in Water, yet when Part of it is dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven away by Calcination, it readily diſſolves and runs <hi>per Deliquium</hi> in a moiſt Air. To which may be added, that tho' a Loadſtone by being heated in the Fire and cool'd again, underwent no viſible Change as to Shape or Size, nor for as much as could be perceiv'd by the Eye, loſt none of it's Parts; yet, by an inviſible Change of Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, effected by the Magnetical Effluvia of the Earth, it may alter its Verticity according to
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:59609:145"/>the different Poſtures it is permitted to cool in: And the like Change I have obſerved in Iron, whoſe Verticity was altered by a Change of Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wrought by ſo weak an Agent as the Earth.</p>
                     <p>To theſe we may add ſeveral Inſtances in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid Bodies; and <hi>firſt,</hi> That, tho' Honey and Water mix'd together in an undue Proportion, reſerve each their diſtinct Natures; yet if four or five Parts of Water be added to one Part of Honey, by ſome ſubtle Agents or other, they are preſently fermented, and unite into one common Maſs; and I am aſſur'd, by a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant who liv'd ſeveral Years in the <hi>Canary</hi> Iſlands, That if a Hogſhead of Wine cloſe ſtop'd be violently roll'd along; the Texture of the Liquor would be ſo chang'd, that, if it were but about a Month old, one of the Ends would be burſt out, and the Liquor loſt. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inſtance in which the Texture of the Body diſpoſes it to be ſo powerfully work'd upon, we have in Glaſs, which upon a ſudden Removal from the Fire into cold Water, is ſubject to fly in Pieces.</p>
                     <p>But an Inſtance which is more remarkable is, That a hot Plate of Copper being permitted to cool upon ſome which were more moderately hot in the Fire, and thence remov'd upon a Plate; ſeveral Pieces like Scales would fly off it, when expos'd to the <hi>Atmoſphere;</hi> and</p>
                     <p>To conclude this Chapter, I ſhall add, That the <hi>Bolonian</hi> Stone acquires ſuch an admirable Quality by Calcination, that, by being plac'd in the Sun-beams for ſome time, it gets ſuch a Degree of Luminouſneſs, as to retain it a
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:59609:145"/>conſiderable time, when remov'd into the dark.</p>

To which may be added, a third Inſtance from that Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Phyſician, who obſerv'd the various <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi> of Diſtempers at the Siege of <hi>Breda,</hi> and ſays, <hi>Annotandum hic meritò Naturae Facultatem ad Pestis Praeſervationem Momenti eſſe maximi: Obſervavi in meipſo contaminatos inviſente ſtatim inguina olere vel axillas; afficiebatur aliquando Caput, noctu inde Sudor, &amp; ſeceſſus tres quatuorve; hoc &amp; aliis accidit, qui fideliter mihi retulerunt.</hi> And theſe Teſtimonies I am rather inclin'd to depend on, becauſe deliver'd by Men of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Credit.</p>
                     <p>Another Suſpicion which I am about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,<note place="margin">A Third.</note> is, That the Laws of Nature, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the producing of ſeveral <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> are not only of larger Extent than what we are us'd to imagin; but likewiſe concur to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of a greater Variety of Effects: For not
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:59609:146"/>to ſpend much time in obſerving, That ſeveral Induſtrious Aſtrologers and Geographers, have, inſtead of Phyſical, given us Mathematical Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſes; having taken pains to deſcribe the Situations and Motions of the fixed Stars and Planets; and likewiſe, that they have been Induſtrious in diſcovering the four little Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, which move about <hi>Jupiter;</hi> as alſo the little Moon, which runs about <hi>Saturn,</hi> as well as ſeveral <hi>Phaenomena</hi> relating to Comets, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſidering the Frame and Conſtitution of thoſe Bodies, which compoſe our Globe; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it not impoſſible to make it out, That there is a Commerce betwixt them and our Globe; as well as ſeveral Laws or Cuſtoms of Nature even in our own Globe not taken notice of by Scholaſtical and Mathematical Writers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Fourth.</note>And I am, not without Reaſon, induc'd to ſuſpect, That this Globe of ours hath undergone ſeveral conſiderable Changes, not only in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Countries, but the internal Parts of it; That which is call'd the Mariners Compaſs, having been, in ſeveral Places, obſerv'd to vary conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably, in its Declenſion from the true North Pole; as for Inſtance, about <hi>London</hi> in the Year 1580 it declin'd eleven Degrees; in 1612 about ſix; and in the Year 1633 about four Degrees. And I have my ſelf, at one time, obſerv'd little or no Declenſion, whereas at another I obſerv'd it to decline near half a Degree. And I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by one who often obſerv'd the Variation of the Compaſs at the <hi>Cape of good Hope,</hi> that, when he was a young Man, he obſerv'd it to decline two Degrees Weſtward; whereas of late, he found the Variation to be ſix Degrees
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:59609:147"/>and about forty eight Minutes; ſo that, by his Obſervation, it had vary'd little leſs than five Degrees, in the times he hath ſayl'd paſt that Place. From whence we may have Reaſon to think, That there are certain Agents very pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, tho' not to be taken notice of, which may work ſeveral, and very conſiderable Changes, even in the Terreſtrial Globe it ſelf; which whether regulated by any certain Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we know not.</p>
                     <p>And beſides theſe, there are ſeveral other unheeded <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> which we have troubled our ſelves very little to conſider about; as the different Weight of our <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> and the Cauſes of that Difference; we having only no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that they proceed from ſome ſubterraneal Effluviums mix'd with the Air; but what other Effects thoſe Effluviums may have upon other Bodies hath been ſcarce diſcover'd.</p>

                     <p>But it is moſt remarkable, that ſeveral Stars have Periodically appeared and diſappeared ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times in the ſame Place, as hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Girdle of <hi>Andromeda,</hi> and about the <hi>Swans</hi> Breaſt, and another amongſt the fixed Stars in the <hi>Whales</hi> Neck.

                        <note place="margin">The Temper of the Air in Groves.</note>And firſt, I ſhall relate a Story of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Air obſerved by a Chymiſt, who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely travelled into <hi>Hungary,</hi> which was the following: That going down into a Grove, at the firſt Entrance of it, he perceived the Air ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly warm; but preſently after for a quarter of an
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:59609:149"/>hour in his deſcent, he felt it conſiderably cold; which cold Region being paſſed, he began to perceive it ſenſibly warmer, and the lower he deſcended the hotter it grew; ſo that, in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Veins, it was hotter than the Air above ground is uſually in Summer: And this Relation was confirmed by a like Obſervation made by a Phyſitian, who told me, that in a Mine, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent did not much exceed an hundred Fathom, the cold Region was extended near to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of it. And this Relation is agreeable with what <hi>Morinus</hi> affirms, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Cold Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in an <hi>Hungarian</hi> Mine, which he viſited, was extended 80 Fathom, after which the Heat ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly increaſed, the lower he deſcended; and the ſame Author affirms, that beſides the different Tempers of thoſe Regions, there is likewiſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, a different Degree of Heat, in the hot Region, correſpondent to the different Seaſons of the Year, <hi>viz.</hi> Winter and Summer.</p>

                           <hi>The Bounds as well as Temperature of the firſt Region are very different.</hi> The Reaſon of both Parts of which Propoſition are plain; ſince the Sun Beams muſt not only penetrate deeper in the Summer than the Winter; but alſo, becauſe the ſolidity or porouſneſs of ſeveral Parts of the Earth may diſpoſe the Soil to Heat or Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                        <pb n="258" facs="tcp:59609:150"/>
                        <p>But to proceed, it is remarkable, that the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt Region is much more temperate, becauſe both the violent Impreſſions of Sun Beams, and rugged Winds, are kept off by the ſides of thoſe Subterraneal Cavities. And that the Power of the Sun Beams is much weakned by thoſe ſides, is plain; ſince, by ſuch like means, the Heat of the Sun may be ſo broken, as to preſerve Ice from thawing all Summer; and not only ſo, but if thoſe ſubterraneal Cavities be ſufficiently guarded with a Cover of Brick, well clayed over; and be, by that means, preſerved from any Intercourſe with the External Air, it may be preſerved without digging deep into the Ground, as is obſerved in the South Part of <hi>France;</hi> ſo that, though the Coldneſs of Subterraneal Cavities may conduce, yet it is not altogether requiſite to preſerve Ice from a Thaw.</p>
                        <p>But the ſubterraneal Regions are not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from exceſſive Heat, by preventing the Intercourſe of the Internal and the External Air, but may be conſiderably leſsned in ſuch Cavities as are conſiderably expoſed to the open Air: as I my ſelf have obſerved in an Iron Mine not above twelve foot deep.</p>
                        <p>As as it is to be obſerved, that this cold Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Air is not apt to be influenced by external Heat in the Summer, ſo neither is the hot Region ſubject to be altered much by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Cold in Winter; which appears from the ſmoaking of ſome Springs in Winter, which are ſupplyed with Water, which had run a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable depth in the ground, or paſſed through ſome Earth that was fitly diſpoſed to warm it in it's Paſſage.</p>
                        <pb n="259" facs="tcp:59609:150"/>
                        <p>But further, that Winters Cold is much more diſpoſed to influence the ſuperficial Region of the Earth than the hot one which lyes under it, appears from Reaſon it ſelf, and may be further confirmed by obſerving, that even Water in freezing loſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                           <hi>That the Temper of the Second Region of the Earth ſeems to be colder than that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove or that below it.</hi> This is both confirmed by Obſervations already cited, and alſo by Reaſon; by the latter, becauſe the Earth, being a Body compounded of Parts leſs agitated than thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our Senſory, they muſt conſequently cauſe a Senſation of Cold;<note place="margin">Why the Middle Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt.</note> and why that Region ſhould have it's Parts leſs agitated, than thoſe about it is plain, becauſe it lyes remoter both from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:59609:151"/>of External, as well as Subterraneal Heat.</p>
                        <p>But here it is to be noted, That though I ſay, the middle Region is coldeſt, yet I would only be underſtood to mean a comparative Coldneſs; for I by no means think that Region to be poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the moſt intenſe Degrees of Coldneſs, ſince neither Ice or Snow have been ever obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be found in it: And though it be compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively colder than thoſe Regions about it; yet, that it is not the coldeſt may be hence argued, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is obſerved in the Summer, that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations which ſteam from the middle Region are ſenſibly warm at the Orifice of the Grove; which they could not be, were the middle Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion through which they paſſed extreamly cold.</p>

                           </note>But to paſs to the ſecond Member of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Propoſition; It is obſerved, <hi>That in ſeveral Places, which may be referred to this middle Region, the Temperature of the Air is different at the ſame Seaſons of the Year.</hi> Which is evident both from Reaſon and Experience.</p>
                        <p>And firſt, from Experience it hath been learnt, by thoſe who have often been in thoſe <hi>Hungari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Mines, as well as ſome here in <hi>England.</hi> And indeed if we conſider the different Heat in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Climates; but more peculiarly the Difference in Soils, it will not be leſs conſonant to Reaſon; for the Soil may be more or leſs porous and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact;<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Temper of <hi>Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions</hi> may be varied by the Soyl.</note> and may have different Subſtances mixed with it, or run through it, which may alter the Temper of it; for there is not always that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Order in Nature, which is in our Thoughts of her; ſince Salts, Marchaſites and Minerals are
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:59609:151"/>diſperſed through the middle as well as the lower Regions of the Earth; and may, by impregnating thoſe Fluids which run through the Earth, cauſe different Refrigerating Effluvia to affect various Parts of the ſame Region; as if, in one Place, it be impregnated with Nitre, and in another with Marchaſitical Earth; the Coldneſs of the former muſt render that Part of the Region the colder of the two. Beſides, the Temper of them may differ upon the account of the Soil it ſelf, which varies according to the ſeveral Degrees of it's Maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſo that for theſe Reaſons, the Temper of Effluvia may be different in the ſame Place at one time from what they are at another in the ſame Place; not to mention thoſe Differences which it may undergo by ſeveral other Accidents, and the Subterraneal Effluvia, which aſcend more or leſs from the lower Regions.</p>
                        <p>And before I leave this Propoſition, it may be neceſſary to advertiſe, That the different De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Heat or Cold, in the ſeveral Regions of the Earth, are not eaſily diſcover'd by thoſe <hi>Thermoſcopes,</hi> which are uſually made uſe of, to diſtinguiſh ſuch Differences; becauſe the Pillar of Air, which preſſes upon the Liquor may dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in it's Preſſure, according to the Length of it; it being longer, and conſequently heavier, the lower it deſcends.</p>

That the Temper of the Third Region is warm, which Warmth va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in ſeveral places.</hi> That it is Warm, and that that Heat varies in ſeveral places, I think is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently atteſted, by the ſeveral Perſons that have gone down into thoſe Mines; but as for the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:59609:152"/>Cauſes of it, thoſe are not ſo eaſily diſcover'd: for I am not a little inclin'd to ſuſpect, That con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Cloſeneſs of thoſe Cavities in which they work, the <hi>Effluviums</hi> of their own Bodies, and of the Metal they work in, may in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure contribute to it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The effects of <hi>Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneal Fires.</hi>
                           </note>But to paſs by this Suſpicion, I ſhall rather briefly intimate, That I conceive the Earth to be ſtocked with ſtore of Subterraneal Fires; and that ſeveral Calorifick Qualities, being carry'd up through Clefts and Veins in the Earth, cauſe a Senſible Heat to be diffus'd through the whole. And that there are ſuch Steams, appears mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly from thoſe Damps, which are often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in Groves; not only in <hi>England,</hi> but <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, Bohemia, Hungary, &amp;c.</hi> which are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo Bituminous and Sulphureous in Smell, as to be apt to take actual Fire.</p>
                        <p>But one thing I muſt intimate here, which is, That tho' I am induc'd to believe, for ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, this Argument valid; yet, I am not without a Suſpicion, that notwithſtanding the Aptneſs which theſe Exhalations have to take Flame; yet, even ſeveral cold Steams may riſe from the lower Parts of the Earth, which may acquire Heat in the Upper Regions; for we ſee, that ſeveral Subſtances, which are apt enough to take Flame, have not the leaſt ſenſible Heat in their Parts before; nay, are ſo far from that, that <hi>Salt-Petre,</hi> which is ſo apt to flame, will, by being diſſolv'd in Water, add a conſiderable Degree of Coldneſs to it: And the like may be obſerv'd in Spirit of Wine, whoſe Spirit, tho' eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable, affects not the Touch with the leaſt Heat, if rais'd in the Form of a Vapor.</p>
                        <pb n="263" facs="tcp:59609:152"/>
                        <p>But that which inclines me to be of the Opinion juſt now mention'd, is, That not only <hi>Morinus,</hi> but ſeveral others have obſerv'd, the Exhalations of Mines conſiderably hot in <hi>Summer</hi> time. And the Experienc'd <hi>Agricola</hi> hath oſerv'd, That the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Steams which pervade the Earth, are ſo powerful, as not to permit a Hore-froſt to lie upon the Ground which they lie under; and the like hath been obſerv'd upon Coal-Mines: And I remember, that an Acquaintance of mine ſhew'd me a piece of Land, which was ſo powerfully penetrated with warm <hi>Effluvia,</hi> that Snow would not lie upon it above two Days, were the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther never ſo cold, which hath been confirm'd by frequent Obſervations; except where Layers of Rock, or ſome other Stony <hi>Concretes,</hi> obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Paſſage of thoſe Mineral Steams. To which may be added, That the Steams near Gold-Mines are ſo copious in <hi>Hungary,</hi> as to give the Leavs of the Trees a Golden-Colour.</p>
                        <p>But notwithſtaning theſe Inſtances, I am apt to doubt, that there are ſeveral Parts of the third Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which by reaſon of their Remoteneſs from ſuch Subterraneal Fires, have not that Heat. But ſince theſe things are but uncertainly gueſs'd at, none having ſo great Curioſity, as to be at the Charges to dig deep enough without proſpect of Gain, I ſhall rather proceed to conſider, That,<note place="margin">Whence the Unuſual <hi>Heat</hi> in ſome <hi>Mines</hi> proceeds.</note> beſides the foremention'd Cauſes, there is in ſome Mines ſuch a degree of Heat, as cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for without another Cauſe; the Inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcence being ſo great, as not to be produc'd without the Concourſe of ſome other Mineral-Steams, or Water to work upon, and promote the mutual Actions and Operations of the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:59609:153"/>and Active Parts of thoſe Mines. And that ſuch Incaleſcenſes may be produc'd in the Bowels of the Earth, I have elſewhere obſerv'd: And further, That Immature Minerals, ſuch as <hi>Marchaſites,</hi> whoſe Parts are impregnated with <hi>Vitriol</hi> and <hi>Sulphureous</hi> Parts, may, by reaſon of their Aptneſs to be diſſolv'd, be able to cauſe ſuch Effects, we may be induc'd to believe, becauſe <hi>Vitriol</hi> hath not only been found in ſeveral Mines in <hi>Hungary;</hi> but likewiſe ſuch Strong and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive <hi>Effluviums,</hi> as were very offenſive to Reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and in a little time fatal to thoſe that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd to work in them. And there is one thing further Remarkable, That ſeveral pieces of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,</hi> which were found in the Bottom of ſome of thoſe Mines, of a ſoft Conſiſtence, preſently, when brought up and expos'd to the open Air, grew hard, retaining ſeveral Golden Streaks in it.</p>
                        <p>But there is one thing here to be noted, which is, That, in Groves which are very deep, the Air is ſo unfit for Reſpiration, as to want a frequent Ventilation; ſo that the <hi>Miners</hi> are wont to ſink an <hi>Air-Shaft,</hi> as they term it, ſome Paces off the Grove, that the Air paſſing from the Grove to that, by a ſhort of Channel, or <hi>Ventiduct,</hi> (which <hi>Agricola lib. v.</hi> and <hi>vi. de re Metallica,</hi> calls <hi>Cuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus</hi>) might keep the Internal Air in ſuch a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as to make it fit to breathe in; tho' the Mines were 200 Yards deep.</p>
                        <p>And <hi>Agricola,</hi> in his Book <hi>de re Metallica,</hi> gives further the following Account of the Courſe of the Air in theſe <hi>Cuniculi,</hi> or <hi>Air-Shafts,</hi> in theſe Words: <hi>Aer autem exterior ſe ſuâ ſponte fundit in Cava Terrae, atque cum per ea penetrare
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:59609:153"/>potest, rurſus evolat foras. Sed diverſa Ratione hoc fieri ſolet; Etenim Vernis &amp; Aeſtivis diebus in altio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem puteum influit &amp; per Cuniculum vel Foſſam laten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem permeat, ac ex humiliori effluit ſimiliter iiſdem diebus in altiorem Cuniculum infunditur, ac interje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto puteo defluit in humiliorem Cuniculum atque ex eo emanat. Autumnali &amp; Hyberno Tempore contra in Cuniculum vel Puteum humiliorem intrat &amp; ex altiori exit: Verum ea fluxionum Aeris Mutatio in temperatis Regionibus fit in initio Veris, ac in fine Autumni; in frigidis autem, in fine Veris, &amp; in initio Autumni:</hi> To which he adds, <hi>Sed Aer utro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que tempore antequam curſum ſuum illum conſuetum conſtanter teneat, plerumque quatuordecem dierum ſpatio crebras habet mutationes, modo in altiorem Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teum vel Cuniculum influens, modo in humiliorem.</hi> And theſe things may give us ſome Reaſon to believe, That there are in the Earth ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Periodical Changes in the Temperature of thoſe Regions, which deſerve our Conſideration. But having ſeveral times enquired about theſe things, I am inform'd that the Air generally goes in the ſame way, both Winter and Summer, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the <hi>Air-Shaft,</hi> and coming out of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular Grove.</p>
                        <p>But to conclude this Chapter: From what hath been ſaid, it may appear, That tho' in ſome Mines, the Earth ſeems to be diſtinguiſh'd into three Rgions, yet generally the Temperature of the whole is various and uncertain: And much more uncertain is it, what is the Conſtitution of the Central Parts of it; and whether that be divided into Diſtinct Regions, or what is the State and Texture as well as Conſiſtency of its Parts, we muſt be content to be ignorant of; ſince one of
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:59609:154"/>the deepeſt Mines we have heard of, being men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd by <hi>Agricola,</hi> in his Book call'd <hi>Bormannus; Cap.</hi> 12. was at <hi>Cotteberg,</hi> which exceeded not 500 Fathom; and if, according to <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> the Semi-diameter of our Globe be 4177 <hi>Italian</hi> Miles, what a Superficial Knowledge muſt we have of it, who have not been able to make our Obſervations above 500 Fathom; and that too, in but a ſmall Part of it's Orb.</p>

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:59609:154"/>not to proceed from Subterraneal <hi>Effluvia;</hi>) and not only in the Extent, but the Temperature of that Region; which may not only be vary'd by the Influence of the <hi>Sun,</hi> but alſo, by the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Nature of the Soil about the Shores, being either <hi>Nitrous,</hi> or <hi>Marchaſitical;</hi> as alſo by the Shallowneſs of the Water, which may contribute to the Warmneſs of it, the Rays of the <hi>Sun</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing refracted by the Subjacent Sands.

                        </note>Theſe things in ſhort being premis'd, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Upper Region, I ſhall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Lower, which is Cold; the Parts of Water being in a leſs violent Agitation than our Senſory: And that the Lower Region is ſenſibly cold, is not only conſonant to Reaſon, but alſo confirm'd by the Obſervation of thoſe, who have dived a conſiderable Depth, not only in the Northern Seas, in <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>America;</hi> but it is alſo further evinc'd, by what is commonly practiſed at Sea, <hi>viz.</hi> to let down Bottles of Wine into the Sea all Night; which, by being immers'd in the Water, will acquire a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Degree of Coldneſs. And I am alſo inform'd by an Obſerving Traveller, that having let down about 400 Fathom of Line, with about 30 pound of
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:59609:155"/>Lead at it, thirty five Degrees North Latitude beyond the Line; the Lead, when drawn up, was as cold as Ice.</p>
                     <p>From which Inſtances it appears, that the Air and Water ſo far agree, that the Parts of them being put into Motion, by External Cauſes, they acquir'd each a conſiderable Degree of Warmth; but, being remov'd and ſeparate from thoſe Cauſes, put on a contrary Quality; ſo that the Air and Water ſeem chiefly in this reſpect to differ, <hi>viz.</hi> in their inverted Order.</p>
                     <p>But further: From what hath been deliver'd, it appears, That tho' the Submarine Regions be ſenſibly colder, the nearer the Bottom; yet their coldeſt Region does not, by any of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> appear to be the <hi>Summum Frigidum;</hi> for tho' I have ſeveral times frozen Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, yet it does not appear, that there is the leaſt Ice generated in the Bottom of the Sea; ſince from the Bottom of the great Ocean 35 Degrees South Latitude, Gray Sand hath been brought up, where the Water was no leſs than two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty Fathom deep: But yet there is one Caution to be added, which makes this Obſervation the leſs to be rely'd on; which is, That one Reaſon why no Ice is to be found in the Bottom of the Sea, may be the Unaptitude of Salt-Water, more than of Freſh, to be congeal'd; it requiring a much greater degree of Cold to freeze Salt-Water, than Freſh.</p>

                        </note>But beſides the Inequalities to be taken No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of at the Bottom of the Sea, there are ſeveral other Things to be obſerv'd; amongſt which the <hi>Gravitation</hi> of the Water, is remarkable; and tho' it be diſputed amongſt <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> whether there be ſuch <hi>Gravitation</hi> or not; yet that there is, appears from ſeveral Experiments.</p>
                     <p>And Firſt, If a Glaſs-Cylinder, with one End open, be immerg'd in a Glaſs-Veſſel, it may be obſerv'd, That as the Cylinder is preſs'd lower, the Air by the Preſſure of the Water, will be ſqueez'd higher and higher, the water riſing gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually below it in the Cylinder. And the like hath been obſerv'd by ſeveral Perſons, who have dived in a Diving-Bell, not only in the Northern Sea, but upon the Coaſt of <hi>Africa;</hi> where as the Bell went deeper and deeper, the Air became more compreſs'd, and the Water accordingly roſe higher and higher in the Bell. And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Preſſure hath been obſerv'd to be ſo powerful, that I have been inform'd by one who let down a Glaſs-Vial into the Sea, near the Straight's Mouth, that, having let it ſink about 40 Fathom, it was burſt in pieces, by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Preſſure of the Water; to which he added, That, having let down an <hi>Aeolipile</hi> of Metal, and ſunk it about 60 Fathom, he obſerv'd when it was drawn up, that the ſides were in ſeveral places bruis'd and compreſs'd by the violent Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Water.</p>

                        </note>Another thing obſervable in the Bottom of the Sea, is, That tho' the Violence of Storms may diſturb it, where it is ſhallow; yet where it is conſiderably deep, the nearer the Bottom, the more calm and undiſturb'd it is. And this hath been confirm'd by the Obſervations of Divers, who have taken Notice, That tho' the Waves were ſix or ſeven foot high, yet, at fifteen Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom deep, the Water was very little diſturb'd, only the Mud was rais'd, which made the Water dark; and what is very remarkable, is, that the Perſon that dived inform'd me, that having ſtay'd a conſiderable depth for ſome time, he found, when he came up again, a Tempeſtuous Storm, which had riſen when he was in the Water, without being taken Notice of by him below. And the like hath been obſerv'd, near the ſhoar of <hi>Manar,</hi> in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> where they dive for <hi>Coral,</hi> in a Sea, that lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Iſland of <hi>Ceylon,</hi> and the Cape of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mori,</hi> which is uſually very much diſturb'd; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as it lies near the <hi>Indian</hi> Ocean, and the Gulf of <hi>Bengala,</hi> formerly call'd <hi>Sinus Gangeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus.</hi> And it hath elſewhere been obſerv'd, That, in conſiderable Storms, the Seas have not been diſturb'd over the Depth of 4 Fathom.</p>

                     <p>And though ſome alledg in favour of <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>'s Doctrin, That <hi>Scaliger</hi> affirms the Sea Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be ſalteſt in it's upper Region; yet it will appear, by comparing the Saltneſs of the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Parts of the Sea with the bottom, that the Obſervation was ill made, and does not general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hold; neither will it favour his Doctrin, ſhould it be alledged, that Sea Salt diſſolved in Water, otherwiſe than common Salt chriſtalizes at the Top of the evaporated Solution; for conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how much Salt Water muſt be impregnated
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:59609:158"/>with; and that the Quantity of Salt in Sea Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath been obſerved by a <hi>Dutch</hi> Geographer to be only as One to Forty;<note place="margin">The propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Salt to Water.</note> it's Diſpoſition to cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalize can be no Argument of the ſwimming of Sea-Salt more on the top of the Water than the other Region.</p>
                     <p>But though I differ in this Point from the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripatetick Philoſophers; yet I do not believe, on the contrary, with ſome, that the Gravity of Salt makes them ſink the more to the bottom; ſince the inteſtin Agitation of the Parts of the Water continually ſhifting Places muſt conſequently car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it along with them; which Conſideration joyned with another, which is, that I have not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually obſerved, Metalline Tinctures ſtronger at the top than bottom, might perhaps give a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion to ſome, that the preſent Argument is leſs cogent, notwithſtanding the ſpecific Gravity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Metals and their Menſtruums does much exceed that betwixt Salt and Water.</p>
                     <p>But further in behalf of the Peripatetick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, it is urged out of <hi>Linſcotten,</hi> that, at <hi>Goa</hi> in <hi>Portugal,</hi> it is uſual for their Slaves to dive, and fetch freſh Water from the bottom of the Sea; but tho' this Matter of Fact were true, yet no ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rules could be drawn thence; becauſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience tells us, that in other Places it is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Beſides it might be probably gueſſed, that,<note place="margin">Springs in the Bottom of the Sea.</note> were it true, that freſh Water might riſe by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Springs covered over with Sea Water, as well as that ſeveral Springs in other Places ſhould be under Water upon the flowing of the Sea: And that there may be ſuch Springs is ſo far probable, that the curious <hi>Hungarian</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor <hi>de admirandis Hungariae Aquis,</hi> ſays, That in

                     <p>But not to urge theſe Relations, I ſhall inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate briefly, That an ingenious Acquaintance of mine, who lives in that City, hath informed me, that that freſh Water is not fetch'd ſo deep as to be ſuſpected to riſe from ſuch Springs; but that it is rather the freſh Water which runs into the Sea from a River not far off, before it is mixed with the Salt Water; which Conjecture I the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believe, becauſe near Mouths of Rivers it hath elſewhere been obſerved, that freſh Water hath for ſome time floated together, without being perfectly mixed with the other Stream.</p>
                     <p>And as for <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s Opinion, it might be ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt it, that by a Veſſel ſo artificially contrived, that it might be opened at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Sea to take in Water, the Water drawn up hath been found to be Salt. But ſince it may be urged againſt this, that the Salt Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being heavier than the freſh, as it was draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up might be mixed with it, by preſſing into the Veſſel; I ſhall add Inſtances not lyable to ſuch Objections; for it hath been obſerved, not only at the <hi>Cape</hi> of <hi>Comori,</hi> but elſewhere, by Divers, that the Water is as Salt at the bottom as at the top; and I am informed, that Divers have not only under the Torrid Zone obſerved the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter exceeding Salt, but have brought ſeveral Lumps of Salt from the bottom with the Sea:
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:59609:159"/>And the like Saltneſs of the bottom of the Sea hath been diſcovered near the Straights of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bralter</hi>'s Mouth: And further, that I might not only be ſure, that the Sea was thus Salt at the bottom, I procured two Quarts of Sea Water, the one taken up at the bottom of the Sea and another at the top; in which, though there was ſome Difference in Colour; yet being Hydroſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically tryed, there was no ſenſible difference in the ſpecifick Gravity of them.</p>
                     <p>But to make out what I have before intimated, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Freſhneſs of the Water in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Sea near <hi>Goa</hi> might be produced by the Riſe of ſome Springs under Water; though it may be objected, that the ſpecifick Gravity of the Salt Water, would in ſome meaſure obſtruct the Riſing of freſh Water: Yet this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will eaſily be anſwered, if we conſider, that according to what we have delivered in our Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droſtatical Paradoxes, and alſo what <hi>Stevinus</hi> hath obſerved, let the Quantity of Water be never ſo great, no more can reſiſt the Riſing of ſuch Springs, but that Pillar of Water which lyes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them in a perpendicular Line; and if the Spring takes it's Riſe from ſome high Place, ſo that the Weight of that Water which lyes in the Vein, be heavier than the perpendicular Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of Sea Water, the Riſing of it can by no means be hindered by the Preſſure of that incumbent Water.</p>
                     <p>But to explain and confirm this Paradox, I ſhall add, that having procured a long Glaſs Syphon, part of it being inverted ſo as to form a ſhort Leg, I filled it with <hi>Claret,</hi> ſtopping the Orifice of the longer Leg with my Thumb, which Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,

                        <note place="margin">The Reaſon of the Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Sea.</note>But to paſs on to the Cauſe of the Saltneſs of Sea VVater, I deny not what <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> and other Moderns teach; but grant, that the Saltneſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a Solution of Salt in the VVater; yet I am apt to ſuſpect, that that Saltneſs is not only ſupplyed by thoſe Salt Rocks, which may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous to, or near the Water; but that the Sea is in a great Meaſure ſupply'd, by Salt waſh'd away and carry'd into it, by Springs and Rain-water, which float into the Ocean. And I am the more confirm'd in this Suſpicion, becauſe ſeveral Chymiſts have not only found Salt in ſome Waters; but have obtain'd a good Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of common Salt upon refining of Salt-Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, which according to Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> is in moſt Soils, which are not ſpent in Vegetation, or waſh'd and conſum'd by the Sun and Rain.</p>
                     <p>But not to inſiſt too long on theſe things, it is not only probable, That the Salts in the Earth, may, by this Means, contribute to the Saltneſs of the Sea; but that, from what hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deliver'd, ſuch Salts may be communicated to it by latent Springs, not to be taken notice of or diſcern'd by us. And further, That ſuch Salt as abounds in the Earth, may ſupply the Sea with moſt of the Salt which is perceiv'd to be in it; we are to render it further probable,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:59609:161"/>to conſider, That the Sea-Salt, and that, are agreeable in the main, with each other; ſince they have almoſt the ſame Shape and Taſte, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the former of which will appear by Evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Cryſtalizing them; and as for ſome ſmall Difference to be perceiv'd betwixt them, that may eaſily ariſe from thoſe Bituminous and other, as well as Nitrous Bodies, which flow into the Sea, and which may be mixed with them, both by the internal Agitation of the Parts of the Water, as well as the outward Action of the Sun and Air.</p>
                     <p>And that there is ſuch Salt diſſolv'd in Sea-Water, might be probable, if it were poſſible ſo to raiſe the freſh Water it was diſſolv'd in, by Diſtillation, as to leave the Saline Parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind; but not now to mention, that not only I, but the Judicious Sir <hi>John Haukins,</hi> in his Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> have, by diſtilling of Salt-Water, obtain'd from it a wholeſome freſh Water; I ſhall, without making a long Digreſſion, proceed to anſwer an Objection, which is urg'd againſt what I have deliver'd, <hi>viz.</hi> That if the Springs acquir'd ſuch a Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by running through the Earth, it would be diſcernible before they emptied themſelves into the Ocean. To this I ſhall anſwer, That beſides thoſe freſh Springs which are viſible to us, there may be ſeveral others which lye too deep for us to take Notice of: But here it may be requiſite to take Notice, That I do not ſay, That the Saltneſs of the Sea wholly depends on ſuch Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies; but that they contribute to the Saltneſs of it.</p>

And as for thoſe different Taſtes which are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in the Sea at ſeveral Places, it is no leſs probable, that they proceed from other adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious Bodies mix'd and incorporated with the Sea-Water; for that the Sea-Salt which is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd in it, is not a ſimple Salt, but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, I have been induc'd to believe by a Salt which I obtain'd from it.</p>
                     <p>And that ſome Catholick Agents may work Changes in the Saltneſs of the Sea, which it would not otherwiſe have, by a bare Solution of thoſe adventitious Bodies that are mix'd in it, I have Reaſon to believe, ſince I have found, That by keeping the Parts of Sea-Water in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation, by a continued digeſtive Heat, it hath conſiderably differ'd in Taſte, from a bare Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sea-Salt in Water. And for a further Confirmation, That the Saltneſs of the Sea is vary'd in ſeveral Places, I ſhall barely intimate thoſe ſeveral Colours, different Qualities, and

Which agrees with what Sir <hi>John Hawkins</hi> hath obſerv'd, who relates the following Story: <hi>Were it not for the Moving of the Sea, by the Force of Winds, Tides and Currents, it would corrupt all the World.

In which Voyage toward the End there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, many of every Ship fell ſick of this Diſeaſe, and dy'd apace, but that the ſpeedy Paſſage into our own
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:59609:163"/>Country was a Remedy to the Crazed, and a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative for thoſe that were not touched.</hi>

                        <note place="margin">The <hi>Saltneſs</hi> of the <hi>Sea</hi> differs.</note>As for the different Degrees of the Saltneſs of the Sea, I ſhall deliver what I have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of, as briefly as I can. And <hi>Firſt,</hi> It hath been obſerv'd, by one to whom I gave a Glaſs conveniently ſhaped to try the ſpecifick Gravity of the Water, that it grew heavier and heavier as he came nearer the Line, till within about thirty Degrees Latitude; from whence to <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica</hi> he obſerv'd no Alteration in the ſpecifick Gravity in the leaſt. And in Confirmation of this I am likewiſe inform'd, by one, who for his own Satisfaction weigh'd the Water, both under the <hi>Aequinoctial</hi> and at <hi>Cape of good Hope,</hi> and found that the Weight of both was the ſame. To which may be added that it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly obſerv'd at <hi>Moſambique,</hi> one of the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Places in the World, that the Sea is ſo ſalt there, that it bears up the Ships a conſiderable Height out of the Water, more than in other Places; and that the Water may be much ſalter in one Place than another, by having more Salt diſſolved in it, does not only appear from what hath been ſaid, but alſo from what is frequently obſerv'd in the different Strength of Brine-Pits.</p>
                     <p>But to paſs from what I have learnt by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, to what I have obſerv'd my ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Proportion of Salt to the Water it was diſſolv'd in, which I have obſerv'd in Sea-Water, betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France.</hi>

                        </note>The firſt Experiment I made to diſcover the Quantity of Salt was this, that having, in a Viol, weigh'd an equal Proportion of Sea-Water taken up at the Surface of the Sea, with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:59609:163"/>Water, the Weight of the former exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the latter of forty fifth Part; but theſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors being more Hydroſtatically try'd, by weighing Sulphur in them, that which in the Sea-Water weigh'd ℥ſs + 10 ½ gr. in Sea-Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, fetch'd from the bottom, ballanced the ſame Weight; but being weigh'd in common Water, it weigh'd ℥ſs + 15 ½ gr. ſo that the Sea-Water was a Fifty third Part heavier than the freſh; the Difference in which way of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, from what was obſerv'd in the former Tryal, I could attribute to nothing, but ſome groſſer Saline Parts mix'd with the common Water, or ſome evaporated Parts of the Sea-Water.</p>
                     <p>Another way we made uſe of to try the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſpecifick Gravity of theſe Liquors, was, by Diſtillation <hi>ad Siccitatem</hi> in a digeſtive Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, in which a Pound <hi>Averdupoiſe</hi> Weight yeilded ℥ſs 10 gr. of Salt; ſo that the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Salt to the Water was as 30 and 12/100 to one, being near the Thirtieth Part.</p>
                     <p>But ſuſpecting that the Quantity of this Salt was much increas'd by imbibing Moiſture from the Air, I caus'd it to be dry'd in a Crucible, and found it weigh'd <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iij + ſs, which is about a Thirty ſixth Part.</p>
                     <p>How ſo much a greater Quantity of Salt ſhould be obtain'd by Diſtillation, is difficult to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture; yet I am apt to think, that it might proceed from ſome Parts of the Water detain'd from flying away, by being enclos'd amongſt the cubical Salts; and this I am apter to believe, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe I have elſewhere prepar'd a Salt, which would coagulate and embody it ſelf with

But further, I weigh'd in the ſame Liquor an equal Proportion of Sea-Salt brought from the torrid Zone and <hi>Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack,</hi> and found, that the Bulk of the former was, to an equal Proportion of that Liquor, as two and a quarter to one, whereas the <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> was not above a hundredth Part, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove one, and 7/10 to one, which is the more ſtrange, becauſe Part of the Compoſition of <hi>Sal Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack</hi> is Sea-Salt.</p>

                     <p>But that I might be ſatisfi'd what was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Degree of Saltneſs, that Water would be impregnated with; I ſhook a Lump of Salt in <hi>Water,</hi> till it would diſſolve no more; and found that a Brine might be made ſo ſtrong, that the Salt would be diſſolv'd in five times its weight of Water.</p>
                     <p>To conclude this Diſcourſe, I ſhall add one thing which hath not been taken notice of by <hi>Hydroſtaticians;</hi> which is, the weight of the Sea-Salt to its Bulk of <hi>Water,</hi> which I have found to be almoſt as two to one; and I likewiſe found, that a piece of <hi>Sal Gemm,</hi> which is more pure and weighty than Sea-Salt was to its Bulk of <hi>Water</hi> about as 2 2/8 to 1.</p>

                     <p>THE Uſe of <hi>Mineral</hi> Waters are ſo Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, and the Methods which ſome Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians take to try them ſo ſlight; that, tho' I am ſatisfied it is difficult, without Experience to Aſcribe Virtues to them <hi>à priori,</hi> by Reaſon of the Great Variety of <hi>Minerals,</hi> which may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate them with Particles of various and very different Natures; I cannot but think, but that if we were furniſh'd with a ſufficient Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Quaeres,</hi> and ſeveral Methods in order to a Diſcovery of them, more nice Tryals might
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:59609:166"/>much Contribute to the clearing up of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Hiſtory of <hi>Mineral</hi> Waters; ſince by a competent number of Experiments it might be hoped, that the Nature of thoſe <hi>Metalline</hi> Salts, with which <hi>Mineral</hi> Waters are Impregnated, might be diſcovered.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore I have lay'd down ſuch ſorts of Experiments, that might be moſt eaſily try'd, <hi>viz.</hi> chiefly Chimical Ones, which may be made at home, without the Inconveniencies of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thoſe Mineral Fountains from whence they ſpring.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe my Deſign is rather to improve Phyſick by the following Obſervations, than to entertain Speculative Naturaliſts; I have chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made it my Buſineſs in the following Papers, to conſider thoſe Waters call'd <hi>Acidulae,</hi> rather than the other term'd <hi>Thermae,</hi> becauſe the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer are of more general Uſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The danger of an ill uſe of <hi>Mineral</hi> Waters.</note>But perhaps ſome may think that the <hi>Quares</hi> hereafter propounded may be too troubleſome, and more than requiſite; ſince the Uſe of <hi>Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> Waters are thought ſo innocent, as to be of no ill Conſequence if Unſuccesful. To which it may be anſwer'd, that tho' when skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully given, they do a great deal of good; yet they are as prejudicial if unskilfully preſcrib'd; and therefore, ſince there cannot be too much Caution, we cannot be too inquiſitive to inform our ſelves of their Virtues; for there may be a great many hidden Qualities in them, and they may be impregnated with ſeveral Metalline Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, which may not be diſcover'd to the Eye or by common Tryals.</p>
                     <pb n="287" facs="tcp:59609:166"/>
                     <p>Beſides, were ſuch Experiments induſtriouſly proſecuted, they might help to diſcover ſeveral other Qualities in <hi>Mineral</hi> Waters, which are as yet unknown; for from the following Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments it is evident, that the Earth, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with Minerals of a Martial Nature, may be more apt to impregnate ſubterraneal Waters than we can otherwiſe imagine; for upon pouring of a Tincture of Galls filtrated through Cap-paper upon filings of Steel,<note place="margin">The Effects of filings of <hi>Steel,</hi> in a Tincture of <hi>Galls.</hi>
                        </note> the Liquor in half an hour became Opacous, and almoſt as black as Ink: The like <hi>Phaenomena</hi> to which were exhibited by Steel in an Infuſion of Braſil or Log-wood made in common Water. To which we may add, that ſeveral Waters have been diſcover'd under ground of very different Taſtes; ſome of which have been found to be corroſive, and others as harmleſs, being endow'd with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Medicinal and Uſeful Qualities; and I am inform'd more particularly of one, which is a Mine of Coral in <hi>Devonſhire</hi> about 360 foot deep, in which was found a Water very thick and red, yet cool and Diuretick, and not in the leaſt nauſeous to the Taſte.</p>

But it is not always neceſſary to make uſe of <hi>Galls</hi> in ſuch Tryals, ſince <hi>Roſe</hi> Leaves, or the Flowers and Bark of <hi>Pomgranates,</hi> will have much the ſame Effect, affording a Cloudy and Blackiſh Tincture.</p>

                     <p>And it is further to be noted, That I made it one Part of this <hi>Quaere,</hi> what Colours would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by a Mixture of <hi>Mineral Waters</hi> with Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Juices; becauſe I have obſerv'd the Root of the Tongue ſometimes Blackiſh upon the taking of Large Doſes.</p>
                     <p>But to return to what I have obſerv'd concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the trying of <hi>Mineral Waters,</hi> by an Infuſion of <hi>Galls;</hi> I not only doubt whether all <hi>Martial Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> will turn a Tincture of <hi>Galls</hi> black, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all liquors which will, are to be eſteem'd <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial;</hi> for I have found that a <hi>Mineral</hi> of a Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Nature from <hi>Steel,</hi> would give it a Black Colour; and that a Liquor, which was a Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Steel,</hi> would not; which induc'd me to think, that ſuch a Tincture was rather the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of ſome <hi>Acid</hi> Fumes, which had work'd on the <hi>Mars,</hi> with which thoſe <hi>Mineral Waters</hi> are Impregnated.</p>
                     <p>To which it may be added, That I have found, that if a Vitriolate <hi>Water</hi> be impregnated with <hi>Copper,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Iron,</hi> inſtead of turning a Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of <hi>Galls</hi> Blackiſh, it only would render it Muddy and Thick. And I had a ſort of white Earth, which I found by Tryals to be <hi>Lead,</hi> that would turn a Tincture of <hi>Galls</hi> Blackiſh, tho' it was altoger void of <hi>Martial</hi> Parts, and probably would have very bad Effects, if taken inwardly. To which I might further add, That a Tincture of <hi>Gold</hi> in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> likewiſe turn'd an Infuſion of <hi>Galls</hi> Black.</p>
                     <p>And thoſe Obſervations I have been the willinger to lay down, becauſe, tho' I would not be thought by them to ſlight the Uſe of <hi>Galls,</hi> in ſuch Tryals, yet I would thence

I would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, for ſuch Tryals, not only the Parts of Aſtringent Plants, but alſo Animal, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Mineral</hi> Subſtances: For, beſides the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringents, I have contriv'd a certain Subſtance, which would not only turn a <hi>Vitriol</hi> Water im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with <hi>Iron</hi> black; but alſo One ſatura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with <hi>Copper;</hi> a <hi>Succedaneum,</hi> to which may be made, by adding to <hi>Sulphur</hi> as it melts over the Fire, and equal Proportion of <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi> finely powder'd, ſtirring them till they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate, and become red: Which Mixture, being put into a Glaſs Retort, with half it's weight of <hi>Sal-Armoniack,</hi> diſſolv'd in Water; let it be diſtill'd in Sand, ſhifting the Receivers as the Liquor drawn off, is ting'd more or

                     <p>And ſuch Tryals as theſe will be of more uſe, than thoſe uſually made with a bare Tincture of <hi>Galls;</hi> ſince there are ſeveral <hi>Mineral</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and other Bodies, which <hi>Mineral</hi> Waters may be impregnated with, which diſcover not themſelves in an Infuſion of <hi>Galls:</hi> As <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi> or <hi>Copper,</hi> may be ſo lock'd up in theſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as not to be perceiv'd, till the Body of the Liquor is open'd by ſome proper Additament.

                     <p>IT is the General Conſent of moſt Men, that the Determinate States of Bodies are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly firſt fram'd by what they call <hi>Nature;</hi> but that they are likewiſe preſerv'd in thoſe States, by the Superintendency of that Power; and that whenever they loſe that State, they are ſaid to be put into a Preternatural One. But if we conſider, that ſuch Changes proceed from Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cauſes, and that thoſe New States depend on the like <hi>Catholick</hi> Agents,<note place="margin">The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> and <hi>Preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral States</hi> ill grounded</note> and the Eſtabliſh'd Laws of Nature; it will appear, That the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction Men uſually make betwixt the <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Preternatural.</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> States of Bodies, is but ill-grounded; and that <hi>Preternatural,</hi> is only a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Term, intimating that that Body hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone a Change, either by the Operation of ſome unheeded or more noted Agent. For

                        <hi>Matter</hi> being altogether void of Senſe and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and not affecting one State more than another, the Changes it undergoes, depend on the Alteration of it's Textures, and New Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of it's Parts, alter'd afreſh, by that Agent, which ſuch a Body was laſt expos'd to.

<pb n="304" facs="tcp:59609:175"/>
                        <hi>Aloes</hi> it ſelf, are conſiderablely ſoftened in their Conſiſtence, by the Temperature of the <hi>Air,</hi> and the Force of External Heat, whilſt they paſs under the <hi>Torrid Zone;</hi> ſo that I am told, that the former of the aforemention'd Drugs was melted into a ſort of <hi>Balſam,</hi> whilſt it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in <hi>Africa,</hi> but when it was brought to <hi>Spain,</hi> it put on a Conſiſtent Form again: And tho' <hi>Aloes</hi> was ſoft whilſt carry'd through <hi>America,</hi> and thoſe hotter Climates, yet when it approach'd our Climate, it preſently became hard.</p>
                     <p>But to bring further Inſtances concerning the <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Preternatural</hi> States of Bodies, I ſhall obſerve, That according the Receiv'd Notion of <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Preternatural</hi> States, it is very difficult to determine the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral State of the <hi>Air;</hi> for, not to inſiſt on the different Temperature of the <hi>Air,</hi> as to Heat and Cold, in different Climes; It may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, Since Heat and Cold, rarifie and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand the <hi>Air,</hi> what is to be eſteem'd the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural State of it, in Reference to Rarity and Denſity? And it is no leſs Queſtionable, what Place is moſt fit to determine it's Natural State, ſince the State of it is not only different in ſeveral Countries; but in thoſe Places at diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Times: And that the Changes, as to the Denſity or Rarity of the <hi>Air,</hi> are very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, appears by the ſeveral Degrees of the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi>'s Gravity, evident in the <hi>Torrecel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Experiments, hereafter to be deliver'd.</p>

                     <p>A Subject which I the rather make Choice of; becauſe, the Air being of ſo general uſe in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, and, by it's almoſt Perpetual Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity, as well to our own Bodies, as thoſe we are here concern'd with, having Conſiderable Effects, in Producing thoſe Various Diſeaſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to Crazy Bodies, upon Changes of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a Diſcovery of it's Nature may be of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and likewiſe, becauſe it may ſhew us how far it concurs in Exhibiting ſeveral other <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">A Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Pneumati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Engin.</note>It conſiſts then of two Principal Parts; a Glaſs Veſſel, and a Pump to ſuck out the <hi>Air</hi> contain'd in it. The Firſt of which is a Glaſs, furniſh'd with a Hole at the Top, to which a Cover is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apted, and alſo a Stop-Cock, fitted to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of it's Neck below; the Cavity of it being large enough to contain about 60 <hi>lib.</hi> of Water, allowing <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>
                        <hi>xvi.</hi> to each Pound.</p>
                     <p>The Diameter (B C) of the Top of the Veſſel (A) is about four Inches, which is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed with a Lip, almoſt an Inch in Height; the Uſe of which is for the Cover to reſt on; which is deſcrib'd in the ſecond Figure, where (D E) denotes a brazen Ring, which is to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and to be cloſely cemented on the Lip (B C) of the firſt Figure. To the Internal Orifice of this Ring is adapted a Glaſs Stopple, ſo exactly, as to prevent any conſiderable Acceſs of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Air: In the midſt of this Cover there is a Hole (H I) about half an Inch Diameter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circl'd with a Ring or Socket, to which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted a brazen Stopple (K) ſo exquiſitely, that it may be turn'd round without admitting in the leaſt Air. Through the lower end of it there is a little Hole (8) made for the Paſſage of a String (8, 9, 10) which is likewiſe to paſs through a ſmall brazen Ring (L) fix'd to the bottom of the Stopple (F G) the uſe of which String is to move what is contain'd in the exhauſted Veſſel, when ſtop'd.</p>
                     <p>That the Stop-cock (N) in the firſt Figure, might more exactly exclude the Air, a thin Plate of Tin (M, T, V, W) was ſoder'd on
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:59609:177"/>the Shank of the Cock (X) of a Length pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the Neck of the Receiver, which was cemented, with a Cement made of Pitch, Roſin and Wood-aſhes, pour'd hot into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Plate; and to prevent the Cement from running into the Orifice (Z) of the Shank (X) it was ſtopp'd with a Cork, to which was fix'd a String, that it might be drawn out of the upper Orifice of the Receiver, and then the Neck of the Glaſs Receiver being preſs'd moderately hot into the Cement, it fill'd the Interſtices betwixt the tin Plate and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, and alſo, betwixt the Receiver and the Shank of the Cock.</p>
                     <p>The lower Part to be deſcrib'd is made up of an Air-pump, ſupported by a Frame of Wood with three Legs (111) ſo contriv'd, that, for the freer Motion of the Hand, on one ſide it may ſtand perpendicular; a-croſs the midſt of the Frame, a Piece of Board is nail'd (222) to which the Pump is fix'd.</p>
                     <p>The Pump is made up of four Parts, <hi>viz.</hi> An exact and ſtrong Cylinder, endued with a Cavity about three Inches croſs; to which a Sucker (4455) is adapted, made up of two Parts; one of which (44) being not ſo large in Diameter, as the Cavity of the Cylinder, a thick Piece of tann'd Leather is nailed on it, by the Addition of which, it cloſes ſo exactly to the Cylinder, that the Air cannot inſinuate; The other Part being a thick Plate of Iron (55) is firmly joyn'd to the middle of the former Part; it is a little longer than the Cylinder; one Edge of it being ſmooth, and the other indented,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:59609:177"/>to the Interſtices of which the Teeth of a ſmall Jaton Nut <hi>(α β)</hi> are to be adapted, which is fix'd by two Staples (22) to the under-ſide of the Board nail'd tranſverſe (222;) on which the Cylinder reſting, it is turn'd by the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium (7.) The laſt Part of the Pump is the Valve (R) being a Hole at the Top of the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder, which is taper towards the Cavity: To this is fitted a braſs Peg, to be put in or taken out, as Occaſion requires.</p>
                     <p>The Engine being thus delineated, the Stop-Cock muſt be well oyl'd with Sallad Oyl, to ſtop the Intervals of the Internal Surfaces of its Parts, and alſo, that it may with leſs diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty turn the Key (S) at Pleaſure; for the like Reaſons the Sucker as well as the Valve is to be oyl'd alſo. And here it is as much ſtrange as to be admir'd, That when Oyl or Water ſeparate, have fail'd in effecting our Deſign, a Mixture of both hath prov'd effectual. Laſtly, That the Ingreſs of Air betwixt the brazen Cover and the Ring, may be likewiſe prevented; it will be convenient to plaiſter the Edges with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Cement, laid on with a hot Iron, that it may the better fill the little Cavities.</p>
                     <p>Things being thus ordered, That no Air may remain in the Cylinder, the Handle is to be turn'd till the Sucker riſes to the Top of it; and then, the Valve being ſhut, it is to be drawn down to the bottom; by which Means, the Air being driven out of the Cylinder, and a Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from without being prevented, the Cavity of the Cylinder muſt be emptied of Air, ſo that the Turn-cock beng turn'd ſo as to afford a Paſſage betwixt the Receiver and Cylinder,

                           </note>But to render theſe Experiments more intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I ſhall take Notice to your Lordſhip of a Notion, which may explicate them; which is, That the Air conſiſts of certain ſpringy Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which, being bent and preſs'd together by incumbent Bodies, always endeavour to remove that Preſſure, and to dilate themſelves; which Notion may be confirmed, by conſidering, that the Air conſiſting of Parts incumbent on one another, the uppermoſt, by their weight, muſt needs compreſs the lower; which compreſſed Parts muſt conſequently have a Power of ſelf-Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: So when a Fleece of Wool compreſſed, upon the Removal of that Preſſure again ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pands it ſelf, the Springineſs of the Air may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:59609:180"/>be explicated by ſuppoſing with the Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> that the Air is a <hi>Congeries</hi> of flexible Particles, of various ſizes and very ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular Figures, raiſed by the Heat of the Sun, and ſwimming in that Matter, which encompaſſes the Earth; which being, by that <hi>Aether</hi> that floats about them, kept ſeparate and in a violent Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, acquire that Springineſs which they would loſe in ſome meaſure by being compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                        <p>By both theſe ways the Springineſs of the Air may be explained; yet by which with moſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I ſhall not now diſpute, being not ſo much concerned about the adequate Cauſe of that Sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineſs, as to manifeſt, that it hath a Springineſs, in order to ſhew the Effects of it; for I am not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed, whether either ſo far explains it's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as to make it intelligible.</p>
                        <p>But in oppoſition to this Notion it may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that tho it were granted, that the Air is made up of ſpringy Particles; yet, it would only account for the Expanſion, and the Dilatati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Springs of the Air, when apparently compreſſed in Wind Guns and other Pneumati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Engines; whereas from theſe Experiments it does not appear, that there was any Compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion before the Air was included in thoſe Guns. To remove this Difficulty, there are ſeveral Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments which prove, that our Atmoſphere is not light, but heavy, in reſpect of ſome Bodies, one of which I ſhall mention here, which is this, that a Lamb's Bladder dryed, whoſe Cavity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd two thirds of a Pint, being preſs'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and counterpoiſed in a very nice Balance, and being prick'd, upon the avolition of the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:59609:180"/>Air contain'd in it, loſt a Grain and an eighth Part of what it weigh'd before; from whence, if we may conceive, that it hath weight, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that a Column of Air of many Miles high leaning on thoſe below, is enough to compreſs and bend their Springs; as when Wool is heaped to a conſiderable height, that which lyes under is compreſſed by that which lyes upon it; and if upon a Parcel of Air, ſo large a Quantity lyes, no wonder, that upon the Removal of that Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, it powerfully expands.</p>
                        <p>As for the Objection, that Water varies not in it's Weight in the lower from the upper Part, it may be anſwered, that the difference betwixt Air and Water is very conſiderable; the laſt not being capable of Compreſſion; whereas Air is. To which may be added the Experiment tryed by Monſieur <hi>Paſcal</hi> (the Son) at the foot, the midle and top of that high Mountain (in <hi>Avergne</hi>) cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Le Puy de Domme,</hi>

                        <p>And if it be objected againſt what hath been propoſed, that if it were ſo compreſſed, it would not be ſo ready to yield to the ſlight Force of Flyes, and even Feathers, it may be anſwered, that as a Piece of Wool ſqueezed together, makes a manifeſt Reſiſtance to the Preſſure of the Hand; ſo the Air does to thoſe Bodies, tho it's Reſiſtance is not ſtrong enough to overpower their Motion, the Parts of it being in a continual Diſpoſition to yield to ſolid Bodies, upon the Account of it's

                        <p>The Cylinder of <hi>Mercury</hi> being thus plac'd in the Receiver, we caus'd a Cylinder of Air to be pump'd out, and after that, another, obſerving the <hi>Mercury</hi> after each, gradually to ſubſide; till at the laſt, it ſubſided a conſiderable way in the Pipe, down into the Body of the Receiver: and to put it beyond diſpute, that the Subſiding of the <hi>Mercury,</hi> depended upon the weaken'd Spring of the included Air, and the <hi>Aequili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium</hi> betwixt the Preſſure of that, and the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the <hi>Mercury;</hi> we turn'd the Key, and permitted Air gradually to re-enter; and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, That the <hi>Mercury</hi> accordingly roſe in the Pipe, almoſt to the height which it was firſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended at; and the Reaſon why it was not rais'd quite ſo high, was, becauſe ſeveral Bubbles of Air, which were before mix'd with the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> riſing above it, depreſs'd, and kept it from aſcending, by taking up more room in the Top of the Cylinder.</p>
                        <p>In trying of which <hi>Experiment,</hi> having once made uſe of <hi>Diachylon</hi> Plaſter, to ſtop up the Top of the Tube, we found, that tho' the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> ſubſided conſiderably upon the Operation of the Pump; yet the Air ſo powerfully inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated it ſelf through the <hi>Diachylon</hi> Plaſter, that it ſunk in the Pipe inſenſibly of it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>Another thing obſervable in this <hi>Experiment,</hi> was, that if, when the Air was exhauſted, it were again permitted to run in too faſt, it would
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:59609:190"/>go near to break the Cylinder, by forcing the <hi>Mercury</hi> up too quick.</p>
                        <p>Beſides we obſerv'd, as we have before inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, That tho' upon the Firſt Exſuctions, the <hi>Mercury</hi> ſubſided above an Inch; yet when it was low in the Receiver, it would not ſubſide over the Breadth of a Barley-corn; beſides, by reaſon of the Parts of the Air, tending to a Reſtitution of their Springs, it check'd and caus'd the <hi>Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver</hi> after it's deſcent, to fly back again a little after each Exſuction.</p>
                        <p>Another thing remarkable in this <hi>Experiment,</hi> is, That having try'd it in one of our ſmall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, we found, that at one Exſuction it fell 18 Inches and a half, and at another time 19 and a half; from whence we may infer, that it might be of no ſmall uſe to conſider, the various <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> afforded by the different Magnitude of the Receivers, in which theſe <hi>Experiments</hi> are made; and alſo the various Bores of the Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which contain the <hi>Mercury;</hi> for thence one might probably gueſs at the Quantity of Air ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted out of the Receiver, by the Subſiding of the <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Tube.</p>
                        <p>To the foregoing Obſervations, we ſhall add, That having once try'd the <hi>Experiment,</hi> in a Tube about two foot long, I found, that upon the firſt Exſuction, the <hi>Mercury</hi> fell above a Span, and afterwards ſubſided by degrees, till the Air was re-admitted, and then it was rais'd near to the top of the Tube again.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, It hath been obſerv'd, That when, by the help of the Pump, more Air hath been ſqueez'd into the Receiver, than what was forc'd in by the Weight of the <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> the <hi>Mercury</hi>
                           <pb n="331" facs="tcp:59609:190"/>would riſe above 27 Digits in the Tube, and would be ſuſpended at that height, till the Air was again let out.</p>

                           </note>Having ſaid thus much of the <hi>Torrecellian Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,</hi> and the ſeveral <hi>Phaenomena</hi> obſervable in it, perhaps it may be expected, that I ſhould ſay ſomething, concerning that Controverſy, Whether or no there be a <hi>Vacuum</hi> in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, when the Air is pump'd out: But being unwilling to take it upon me to determine ſo nice a Controverſy; I ſhall only intimate, that were the Cavity of the Receiver void of Matter, it would be a difficult thing to conceive, how we ſhould have viſible <hi>Idea's</hi> of things contain'd in it; ſince they muſt either be convey'd to our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory by the reflected Rays of Light, or they muſt proceed from ſome ſenſible Emanations from the Bodies themſelves. And from the foregoing Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth <hi>Experiment,</hi> it appears, That the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of a <hi>Load-ſtone</hi> do permeate the Cavity of the Receiver, which makes it probable, that the Magnetical Steams of the Earth do ſo too.</p>
                        <p>But on the other hand, it may be alledg'd, That ſince the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of a <hi>Load-ſtone</hi> may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Receiver, when it ſeems full of Air, it may be urg'd, that the ſubtle Emanations of that Subſtance are only diſpers'd through the Vacuities of the Air; and conſequently when that Air is exhauſted, the Spaces which the Air poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before, may be left void of Matter; for from the Thirteenth <hi>Experiment</hi> it appears, that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which, if cloſely pinned up together, takes up but a ſmall Space, may be diſpers'd through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Receiver, a very ſmall Portion of the Match being able to fill the whole Cavity of it
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:59609:191"/>with Fumes. And as for the Arguments before alledg'd in favour of a Plenitude; they rather ſeem to argue, that it may be, than that it really is; and the Conſequences uſually drawn in Proof of ſuch a Plenitude, are rather grounded on the <hi>Carteſian</hi> Notions of a Body, than on Subſtantial <hi>Experiments;</hi> for they thinking it a Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction <hi>in Adjecto</hi> ſo ſay, a Space can be void of Body, ſince they make Body and Extenſion inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable; they therefore in favour of their own Doctrin draw Inferences from their own Poſitions to argue for a Plenitude.</p>
                        <p>But to leave ſo Nice and Doubtful a Diſpute, I ſhall proceed to lay down the following Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements: Firſt, That the Difference which ſometimes happens betwixt the riſing of <hi>Mercury</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> and beyond Seas, being about two Digits, it rather proceeds from the Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Inches, compar'd with thoſe beyond Seas, than any ſuch conſiderable Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the Weight of the <hi>Atmoſphere.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to be advertiſed is, That except more than ordinary Care be taken, when the End of the Cylinder is immers'd in the Veſſel of <hi>Mercury,</hi> ſeveral Bubbles of Air will riſe to the Top of the Tube, which, being condenſed with Cold, will permit the <hi>Mercury</hi> to riſe higher in the Tube; but being expanded with Heat, would ſenſibly depreſs it.

                        <p>If it ſhould be demanded, What Methods are to be taken to prevent the Intruſion of the Air, the following Requiſites are to be obſerv'd: Firſt, the lower Orifice of the Cylinder muſt be ſmooth, and ſo much inverted on each ſide, as not to exceed a quarter of an Inch in Diameter.
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:59609:191"/>Secondly, the Tube muſt be fill'd ſo full, as not to admit of any Air, betwixt the Finger and the <hi>Mercury.</hi> Thirdly, before the Tube is quite fill'd, it will be requiſite to invert the Tube, that the Air included in it, may, by aſcending to the Top, and upon a Re-inverſion back again, gather all thoſe little Bubbles of Air, which are diſpers'd through the <hi>Mercury,</hi> as it paſſes from one end of the Cylinder to another; and to drain the <hi>Mercury</hi> more exactly you may, by applying a hot <hi>Iron,</hi> cauſe thoſe leſs Bubbles, which are not excluded by the former Method to break forth, which will be promoted by ſhaking the Veſſel upon every Drop of <hi>Mercury,</hi> put into the Pipe.

                           <note place="margin">Concerning the ſame.</note>HAving fill'd a Glaſs Viol with Water, which contained ſomething above a Pound, I took a Glaſs Pipe, about as thick as a Gooſe Quill; and having put one End of it into the Neck of the Bottle, and clos'd it with Cement, I fill'd the Pipe half full with Water, ſticking a piece of Paper at the Superficies of the Water on the outſide of the Pipe, which being plac'd in the Pump, after the Air had been pump'd a while; above ſixty Bubbles of Water as big as Peaſe roſe out of the Water, one after another;
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:59609:194"/>and the Water in the Bottle ſo far expanded, as to riſe quite up to the Top of the Pipe; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing permitted to ſubſide, ſeveral Bubbles of Air roſe out of it afreſh, as ſoon as it renew'd its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion as before; but upon a reingreſs of the Air, it preſently ſubſided almoſt to the Bottom of the Pipe.</p>
                        <p>Beſides which, the following <hi>Phaenomena</hi> were obſervable: <hi>First,</hi> That thoſe Bubbles, which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended laſt, were much larger than the former, either, becauſe their Parts were more expanded than before, or becauſe more Bubbles of <hi>Air</hi> were united together, but whatever was the Cauſe of it, we obſerv'd, that they aſcended much ſlower than before.</p>
                        <p>Another thing to be obſerv'd was, that tho' Bubbles are uſually wont to riſe above the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Water, encompaſs'd with a thin Film; yet, in this Tube, the Surface of the Water being Convex, the leſs protuberant Parts of the Bubble were covered with Water.</p>
                        <p>Another Obſervation which occurr'd was, that whereas thoſe Bubbles which roſe at the Beginning of the Operation, divided the Water which they paſs'd through, in their Aſcent; theſe latter expanded Bubbles, filling up the Cavity of the Cylinder in their Paſſage, rais'd the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before them; till the Air was again permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to re-enter the Receiver, and then they wholly diſappeared.</p>
                        <p>From which Obſervations it may Naturally be inferr'd; <hi>First,</hi> Bodies under Water may be preſs'd upon by the <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> as well as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent Water; <hi>Secondly,</hi> It cannot be hence inferr'd, that the Intumeſcence of the Water
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:59609:194"/>proceeded from any Elaſticity in it; ſince, it might more probably proceed from the Elaſticity of the Air lodg'd in the Pores of the Water. And to make it probable, that thoſe Bubbles proceeded from ſmall Particles of Air, diſpers'd through the Pores of the Water, and not from any ſpirituous Parts of the Liquor expanded, I ſhall ſubjoyn the following Experiment.</p>

                        <p>THO' it be generally alledg'd, that the Bubbles which riſe in the Cylindrical Tube, in the foregoing Nineteenth Experiment, are Particles of Water expanded, upon a Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of the Incumbent Weight of the Air; Yet I am apter to believe them really Parts of Air diſpers'd through the Water; becauſe, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the re-entring of the Air, the Water was not impell'd quite to the Top, but was depreſs'd, by the <hi>Air</hi> lodg'd above it, almoſt an Inch, which, being collected together, was able to reſiſt the Preſſure of the Air.</p>

                           <note place="margin">The Bubbles which riſe in Water, Aerial, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note>But in order to a further Diſcovery, whether the aforeſaid Bubbles were Water or not? We try'd the Nineteenth Experiment in a ſmall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, and upon drawing out the Air, the Water ſubſided; upon which, ſeveral Bubbles riſing to the Top of the Cylinder, prevented the Riſing of the Water, half an Inch, being
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:59609:195"/>poſſeſs'd by the Bubbles of the Air, collected at the Top of the Cylinder: And we were further perſwaded, that thoſe Bubbles were Aerial, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Air, being a ſecond time exhauſted, the Water contain'd in the Tube, was, by the Spring of that <hi>Air</hi> contain'd in the Cylinder, depreſs'd below the Surface of the Water which was without the Tube, having a Convex Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies, as Water expos'd to <hi>Air</hi> in ſuch Tubes uſually hath, but rather more protuberant: And to demonſtrate, that thoſe Bubbles were really made up of Aerial Particles, when the Air was almoſt exhauſted, and the Water had ſubſided near as low as the external Water, by applying Water to the Tube, which contain'd the <hi>Air,</hi> we obſerv'd that it was ſo far expanded, as to depreſs the Water down to the Bottom of the Tube, ſeveral Inches below the External Water: So that the <hi>Air,</hi> which was before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded to near a hundred times it's extent, was capable of being further expanded by Heat.</p>
                        <p>But I was yet further confirm'd in my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that thoſe Bubbles were nothing but <hi>Air,</hi> lodg'd in the Pores of the Water, becauſe the Air being exhauſted out of the Receiver, the ſubſiding Water yielded not Bubbles as before, except a few ſmall ones, when it was near pump'd out. And what I took for a ſtronger Argument was, that the ſame Experiment being try'd with Mercury, ſeveral Bubbles likewiſe roſe to the Top of the Cylinder; and the Mercury ſubſiding a ſecond time, upon the Exſuction of the Air, ſeveral Bubbles appear'd in the Bottom of the Cylinder; which grew bigger and bigger as the Surface of the Mercury deſcended lower. From
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:59609:195"/>whence it appear'd, that a Body,<note place="margin">The Expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter depends on the <hi>Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of the Air lodg'd in its Pores.</note> more ponderous than Water, might contain Aerial Particles in it's Pores, capable of expanding themſelves, when the Cauſe of their Compreſſion is taken away; ſo that we have Reaſon to believe, that the Intumeſcence of the Water, not only in theſe Experiments, but alſo the <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>Theſe things being premis'd, it would be a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſome Importance, and of no ſmall Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,<note place="margin">Whether Air be a primogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al bedy or not?</note> to determine, whether what we have ſaid of the Air be true, to conſider whether Air be really a Primogenial Body, and inconvertible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Water, and <hi>Vice versâ,</hi> or not: But it being as difficult, as requiſite, we ſhall rather chuſe to offer what may be urg'd of either the Affirmative or the Negative.</p>
                        <p>And firſt, in favour of the inaptitude of Air to be turn'd into Water, or of Water into Air, it may be urg'd; that beſides, that it hath been the Opinion of ſeveral Philoſophers, it hath likewiſe been found impoſſible by Experience to effect ſuch a Change in either of them; And the diligent <hi>Schottus Mecham. Hydraulicopneumat. Part</hi> 3. <hi>Claſſ.</hi> 1. relates, that in the <hi>Muſaeum Kircheria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> Water hath been hermetically ſeal'd in a Glaſs with a long Neck, and kept there this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years, without undergoing any Change: Nor, indeed, do we perceive the leaſt alteration in the Nature of Air, Hermetically ſeal'd in Glaſſes for Chymical Uſes, tho' it may acquire ſeveral Degrees of Heat in them: And it may very
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:59609:196"/>plainly be ſeen, that tho' Water is divided into ſmaller Parts, and rais'd in the form of Vapours, by Heat; yet it is ſo far from being turn'd into Air, that in Chymical Diſtillations, it falls down into the Receiver in the form of a Liquor. And likewiſe Volatile Spirits and Salts, tho' their Parts ſwim up and down in the Receiver for ſome time, yet the former preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſe into a Liquor, and the latter, into Salts.</p>
                        <p>And further it may again be urg'd, that tho' the Parts of Water may be put in ſuch an Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as in ſome meaſure to counterfeit the form of Air, yet ſince the quick Coalition of thoſe Parts into a fluid Form, argues the impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of giving them a due Texture, requiſite to add to Air the Springineſs obſervable in it; it is a ſtrong Argument againſt the Poſſibility of effecting ſuch a Change. And that a bare Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Agitation of Parts is not ſufficient to add Springineſs to a Body, appears from the foregoing Experiment concerning a piece of Match, included in our Receiver; where the Agitated Parts of Smoak, were by no means capable of hindering the Expanſion of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der contain'd in it.</p>
                        <p>And tho' <hi>Joſephus Acoſta</hi> tells us, that Grates of Iron have been ſo much corroded in the Air, as to be turn'd into a Subſtance which would crumble into Powder like parched Straw; and tho' the Accurate <hi>Varenius</hi> hath obſerv'd in the <hi>Iſſands</hi> call'd <hi>Azores,</hi> that by the Sharpneſs of the Air even the Tiles of the Houſes have been corroded; yet are they no Arguments, that ſuch corroſive Humors may put on the form of Air;
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:59609:196"/>ſince ſuch <hi>Phaenomena</hi> may be accounted for, by the Mixture of corroſive Steams mix'd with it; which are ſo far from being endow'd with the true Qualities of Air, that they may, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they are mix'd with the Air, retain their own Natures; which is evident in ſubliming of <hi>Sal Armoniack.</hi> And I have had a ſubtle Saline Body, which would not only riſe it ſelf, retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it's own Nature, but would alſo raiſe the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Gold along with it, whoſe Parts would alſo retain their own Natures, and ſtick to the Top of the Receiver like pure Gold.</p>
                        <p>I remember that once having ty'd a Bladder to the Neck of an <hi>Aeolipile,</hi> when the Water was forc'd out into it, ſo as to diſtend it, we ſlip'd it off, and having ty'd it cloſe, put it into our Receiver; where we obſerv'd, that upon the Exſuction of the Air, it was conſiderably expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: And tho' the Bladder, when taken out of the Receiver, continu'd in the Cold for ſome time; yet the included Subſtance continu'd near as fully diſtended: But notwithſtanding the Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibleneſs of this Experiment, I could not but ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that the Diſtenſion rather proceeded from the Air, which upon the firſt working of the <hi>Aeolipile</hi> came out with it, than from any parts of the Water converted into Air.</p>
                        <p>But to proceed to what may be alledg'd, to Countenance the Change of Water into Air; If a good <hi>Aeolipile</hi> be plac'd upon hot Coals, the Water will ſometimes ſpring three or four foot high into the Air; and when taken off the fire, will continue to emit copious Streams: And if, when it is taken from the fire, almoſt empty, the Neck be immers'd in Water, as ſoon
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:59609:197"/>as it begins to ſuck in Water, it will raiſe Store of Bubbles, which ſeem to proceed from Water too much expanded by the Heat of the <hi>Aeolipile;</hi> and if, when that <hi>Aeolipile</hi> is almoſt full of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a live Coal be held before the Neck, it will manifeſtly be kindled, by very vehement Steams which flow out of it, which will have the more powerful Effects, the nearer the Coal is held to the Mouth of the <hi>Aeolipile.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But ſince by holding a Knife before theſe Steams, they will be condenſed upon it into Water; and thence appear not ſo much to have acquir'd the Nature of Air as to have their Parts put into a violent Motion, I ſhall add a Relation from the Induſtrious <hi>Kircher,</hi> of a Famous <hi>Hudraulick</hi> Engine,<note place="margin">See Figure the 15th.</note> which he made by the Order of <hi>Innocent</hi> the Tenth.

                        <p>And I rather cite this Account, becauſe it is deliver'd as <hi>Kircher</hi>'s own Obſervation; and had I, when I was at <hi>Rome,</hi> taken notice of theſe Engines; and found that the <hi>Effluviae</hi> which blew the Organs, were not again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed into Water, I ſhould be apt to believe it not impoſſible to turn Water into Air; it being altogether impoſſible, That the Air lodg'd in the Pores of the Water, ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſo large a Quantity of Air, as is requiſite to blow the Organs: I therefore was induc'd to think, that it might proceed from ſome Parts of the Water put into a very brisk Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſince I had obſerv'd, as I paſs'd betwixt <hi>Lyons</hi> and <hi>Geneva,</hi> that the River of <hi>Rhone,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a ſudden ſtraitned betwixt two Rocks, which are ſo near, that a Man may ſtand with one Foot upon one, and the other Foot upon the other, ſome Parts of the Water were put into
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:59609:198"/>ſo violent a Motion, as to be rais'd into the Air a conſiderable Height, and at a diſtance to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear like a Miſt; tho' I muſt confeſs it difficult to conceive, how ſuch Vapours ſhould paſs through a leaden Pipe of ſuch a Length, ſince we ſee that Vapours are condenſed into Liquids, in a much leſs time, in the Heads of Alembicks, and the Necks of <hi>Aeolipiles,</hi> when once the Motion of their Parts are checked by Cold.</p>
                        <p>But leaving this plauſible, tho' not ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Experiment, I ſhall proceed to another, which is this; Having filled a Glaſs Bubble, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of containing about three Ounces, with near equal Parts of Oyl of Vitriol and Water, half a dozen Iron Nails being caſt into it, we ſtopp'd the Cylindrical Neck of the Tube with Diapalma, ſo cloſe, as to exclude the Air alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; which being done, we immers'd the Neck of this Bubble into a Glaſs Veſſel full of the ſame Liquor, and in a little time perceiv'd Bubbles to riſe to the Top of it, being rais'd by the Heat produced by the Action of the Oyl upon the Nails; and this Air was ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd, in a little time, as to depreſs the Water quite out of the Bubble into the Cylindrical Neck of it: But leſt that Preſſure ſhould be thought to proceed from the Agitation of thoſe inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Parts of Matter, we obſerv'd, That tho' the Veſſels were expos'd to the Air for four days, to give the Motion of the Parts time to ceaſe, had the Effect proceeded from them; we obſerv'd, That the Liquor, all that time, continued depreſſed, the Space beforementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned being filled with Air. And, what was worthy to be noted, Upon a ſmall degree of
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:59609:198"/>Heat approaching the Bubble, the included Air was further dilated. And the like <hi>Phaenomena</hi> ſucceeded upon a Tryal with Nails corroded in <hi>Aqua fortis;</hi> From which Experiments, it might be inferred, That if Water be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible into Air; yet it ſeems probable that it may be generated anew.</p>
                        <p>And that Air and Water are mutually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible into each other might further be urg'd, as nothing but what the <hi>Aristotelians</hi> teach and allow of. But we ſhall rather urge, That if what <hi>Democritus, Lucippus</hi> and <hi>Epicurus,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with other Naturaliſts teach be allow'd of, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Qualities of Bodies depend on the different Figures, Shapes and Textures of the Parts of Matter, they conſiſt of; it will be reaſonable enough to think, That the Texture of the Parts of Water being alter'd, they may acquire the ſeveral Qualities of Air; ſince it is certain, That the Parts of Matter may, by a lucky Concourſe of Cauſes, become ſpringy: So Silver by being beaten with a Hammer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires Springineſs, which it loſes by being heated in the Fire, and becomes flexible.</p>

<pb n="348" facs="tcp:59609:199"/>when the Air was pretty well exhauſted, ſeveral Bubbles roſe to the Top and broke; but all of them finding an eaſy Paſſage through the Water, did not elevate it as when they aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a narrower Cylinder; but upon an Admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Air into the Receiver again, the Water was ſenſibly depreſſed.</p>
                        <p>To try whether diſtilled Water was more ſubject to expand than common Water; I put two Ounces of it into a Glaſs Bubble, which wrought to the Middle of it's Neck; but it neither ſwelled nor yielded Bubbles upon an Exſuction of the Air.</p>
                        <p>But having put diſtilled Water into two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Philoſophical Eggs, the Neck of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer being ſtraitned with a Glaſs Tube, we plac'd them in the Receiver, and found a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Difference upon the Exſuction of the Air; for in that which was ſtraitned, the Air ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly elevating the Water, ſeveral Bubbles were gather'd about the bottom of the Glaſs Tube; whereas in the other Egg, the Water was not in the leaſt elevated; and though the Bubble in the laſt-mentioned, diſappear'd upon the Re-ingreſs of the Air, thoſe above the Tube continu'd viſible, only a little contracted, for a conſiderable time; the Surface of the Water, which was before elevated, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed lower than when firſt put into the Egg.</p>
                        <p>And after a days time having again ply'd the Pump, we obſerv'd, That the Bubbles were ſo much drawn out before, that we could ſcarce diſcern a Bubble in either; but that in which the Cylindrical Tube was plac'd, ſwell'd the
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:59609:199"/>Breadth of a Barly Corn, tho' the other did not; yet, in the former, upon a Re-ingreſs of Air, it ſubſided again, and whether that Swelling was caus'd by the Rarefaction of the Water, or the Spring of ſome latent airy Parts, is not eaſy to determine.</p>

                        <p>Having put Oyl of Turpentine into a Glaſs Bubble, we obſerv'd, That it afforded a good Quantity of Bubbles, which expanded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their Aſcent, and would ſometimes raiſe the Oyl in the Tube ſo much as to make it run over.</p>
                        <p>But beſides the foregoing, we try'd the like Experiments with other Liquors, amongſt which, a ſtrong Solution of Salt of Tartar afforded very few Bubbles, and thoſe much
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:59609:200"/>later than other Liquors: Spirit of Vinegar likewiſe yielded very few. Red Wine afforded Bubbles pretty plentifully, which chang'd Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by moving in an oblique Aſcent, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a ſort of Froth near the Top, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently diſappear'd: Milk afforded plentiful Bubbles, which elevated that Liquor more than common Water.</p>
                        <p>We likewiſe put Eggs into the Receiver, to ſee whether the Subſtance contain'd in the Shells would break them; leaving the Film within it whole, as that Subſtance frozen had done; but it ſucceeded not.</p>
                        <p>We put Spirit of Urine into a Glaſs Egg, filling another up to the Middle of the Neck with common Water; to which we added as much Spirit of Wine as rais'd it half an Inch higher; and into a Glaſs which differ'd from the former only in having a flat Bottom, we pour'd rectify'd Spirit of Wine, till it roſe to ⅔ of the Neck: And the Edges of theſe three being mark'd, we put them into a Receiver. Upon the Exſuction of the Air the Mixture of Water and Spirit of Wine afforded very few Bubbles: The Spirit of Urin ſwell'd near an Inch and a half above the Mark, affording Store of Bubbles, which formed a Froth, upon which ſeveral larger Bubbles lay, which were plac'd one above another, to the Top of the Tube: The Spirit of Wine afforded Bubbles till we were weary of pumping, which aſcended very ſwiftly, and immediately diſappear'd at the Top, firſt lifting up the Surface of that ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Liquor ſo as to form a thin Film. And it was further obſervable, That the Motion of
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:59609:200"/>theſe Bubbles in their Aſcent, was in a ſtrait Line; whereas thoſe of the Water and Wine made a Line, which on each ſide appear'd like the Teeth of a Saw: And laſtly, in this Spirit we took Notice, That the order which theſe Bubbles aſcended in, was in Lines parallel, and of an Equal Diſtance from each other; the Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles likewiſe following each other, in ſuch an order, as to form a ſort of Bracelet, one end of which ſeem'd to riſe from a certain Point at the Bottom of the Glaſs.</p>
                        <p>When Air return'd into the Receiver, the Bubbles on the Spirit of Wine gradually ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided; yet neither that, nor the Mixture of Water and Spirit were depreſs'd below the Mark: But the Spirit of Wine continu'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded, near half an Inch, which I found to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon ſeveral Tryals.</p>

As for the other, it continu'd at the Bottom all the while. But ſome time after, the Pump being ply'd, it rais'd it ſelf conſiderably; but about ſixty Parcels of Air as big as Peas, finding vent, and getting out, it preſently ſubſided; tho' upon a further Expanſion of the Air, it roſe again, and ſubſided, which ſucceſſive Aſcent and deſcent, it continu'd Nine times after after the Pump ceas'd working; but when the Air was again let in, it was preſently fix'd at the Bottom.

But to evince the contrary, we ſuſpended a Watch in our Receiver, by a Packthred, and obſerv'd, That the Sound was not only audible at the ſides of the Receiver; but that that which was likewiſe perceiv'd by the Ear, held near the Cover, was different from that which we heard at the ſides of the Receiver; but the
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:59609:202"/>Air being drawn out, we could not perceive the leaſt Sound, tho' the Motion of the Minutes aſſur'd us, that the Pendulum continu'd it's Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet upon admitting of Air again into the Receiver, the Sound was again renew'd; which <hi>Experiment</hi> ſeems to evince, that the Air is the Chief <hi>Medium,</hi> through which Sounds are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh'd: Yet it is not a little ſtrange, that ſo ſlight a Stroke as that of the Pendulum, ſhould give ſuch an Impulſe to the Ambient Air, as to inable it to communicate a Motion to the ſides of the Receiver, ſtrong enough to put the External Air into an Undulating Motion.</p>
                        <p>But having ſupported a Bell in the Middle of our Receiver, by a large Stick, which reach'd from one ſide to the other, the Diameter of the Bell, being about two Inches, we obſerv'd, that tho' the Sound in the Receiver, was not equally as ſharp as in the open Air; yet there was no conſiderable Variation, when the Air was drawn out; which evinces, that a ſubtler <hi>Medium</hi> than the Air, is not altogether incapable of propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating Sounds, no more than Air; however, in the foregoing <hi>Experiment</hi> try'd with a Bell, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended in a Glaſs-Tube, it may not without Reaſon be ſuſpected, that the Cavity of the Tube was not wholly void of Air, ſince Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience informs us, that it is impoſſible to fill the Glaſs-Cylinder, ſo as to keep the Upper Part of the Tube void of Air, ſince the Aery Parts lodg'd in the Pores of the <hi>Mercury,</hi> fly up into it.</p>

                        <p>And Firſt, From the Riſing of the Sucker, and the Weights fix'd to it, we may call in Queſtion, what ſome teach concerning Suction, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is a ſort of Endeavour, to draw the Body ſuck'd, in the Parts of that Body which is ſaid
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:59609:206"/>to ſuck; for tho' when we ſuck a thing with our Mouths, there is a Manifeſt Endeavour of our Mouth to draw the Body ſuck'd; yet the Cavity of the Cylinder is not ſo diſpos'd by any Endeavour in the Glaſs-Tube. Nor can the Aſcent of the Sucker be attributed to any ſucking Force of every Part included in the upper Part of the Cylinder, ſince it appears not, how ſuch Aery Particles ſhould be hook'd in the Pores of the Sucker, or how they ſhould be able to raiſe ſuch a Weight: Nay, that thoſe Particles of Air do not draw it up, is further evident; ſince by admitting more Air in, that ſuppoſititious ſucking Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is diminiſh'd, and not increas'd: And for the ſame Reaſon it is evident, that it cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a <hi>fuga Vacui;</hi> for there is the ſame Reaſon for an Endeavour to prevent a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> tho' a little more Air be let in, as there was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; ſince there ſtill remains a <hi>Vacuity.</hi> Nor can the weaken'd Attraction, upon letting in of Air, be attributed to the Reſiſtance of the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity,</hi> but rather the Spring of the included Air; ſince when in the former <hi>Experiment</hi> it was plain, that the riſing of the Sucker and Weights, was not obſtructed by the Cavity of the Cylinder, when void of Air.</p>

                           </note>But to proceed: From hence further we may be directed, what to think of <hi>Nature</hi>'s Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> which hath been ſo long held as an <hi>Axiom</hi> in the Schools: For beſides, that the Inſenſible Parts of Matter, can neither have Senſe to perceive any ill conſequences in the Univerſe, which would enſue a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> nor be able to know how as Intelligent Parts of Matter to prevent it; (for if they did, <hi>Nature</hi> may be ſaid in a great

                           <hi>Experiment,</hi> inſtead of ruſhing into the Receiver, ſhe leſs cautiouſly rais'd up the Valve, and kept her ſelf out. But, I ſay, beſides the Inſenſibility of Matter, it may farther be urg'd againſt that <hi>Axiom,</hi> that the Endeavour which thoſe Bodies may ſeem to have, rather is to fill than to prevent a <hi>Vacuum;</hi> ſince upon the drawing down of that Valve, the Air which ruſh'd in, could not prevent what was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in Being. Beſides in our XIX<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                           <hi>Experiment,</hi> it might be demanded, Why the Water which deſcended into the Tube, upon the Exſuction of the Air, did not rather keep it's place to prevent a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> or why for the ſame Reaſon it did not aſcend before the Re-ingreſs of the Air.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, the Air may rather be ſaid to ruſh in again, as being impell'd by the Spring of the Neighbouring Air, than a Deſign to fill the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuities, ſince from our XVII<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                           <hi>Experiment,</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, That when the Receiver was ſuppos'd to be full, we could by the help of the Sucker, find the Spring of Subſequent Air impell'd by it, ſtill force more into it; and even in Wind-Guns it is manifeſt, that the Air compreſs'd as much as it is in our Receiver, may be ſqueez'd into half the Room.</p>
                        <p>And from the foremention'd <hi>Experiments,</hi> it may further be deduc'd, That the Reaſon, why <hi>Metaphorically</hi> ſpeaking, Bodies may ſeem to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get their own Natures, to ſhun a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> ſeems to conſiſt in this, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Weight of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent Water, or the Preſſure of the ſubjacent Air were not ſtrong enough to preſs down or buoy up one another; for from our Nineteenth
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:59609:207"/>
                           <hi>Experiment</hi> it appear'd, that when the Preſſure of the Air was taken away, the Weight of the Water it ſelf was ſufficient to make it ſubſide, tho it left no Air behind it: But further, from this laſt mention'd Experiment it appears, that it is poſſible, Even by Weights, to meaſure how far Nature is diſpos'd to prevent or fill Vacui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; ſince a ſmall difference in Weight deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, by depreſſing or permitting the Sucker to riſe, how far Nature's Abhorrency of a <hi>Vacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> depended on the Cauſes we have ſo often mention'd.</p>
                        <p>But here it may be requiſite to advertiſe, that by Vacuities, I do not mean Spaces altogether void of Matter, but void of ſuch as may be perceiv'd; ſo that I take the Word <hi>Vacuum</hi> in the Common, not the ſtrict and Philoſophical Senſe of the Word.</p>
                        <p>But laſtly, from this XXXIII Experiment it appears, that the Weight of the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> we live in, is ſtronger than what Men uſually think it is; And probably, near the <hi>Northern</hi> Pole, it is much ſtronger: Since, if what <hi>Varenius</hi> obſerves, the Air is ſo condens'd in <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> as to hinder the Motion of a <hi>Pendulum,</hi> except moved by a heavier Weight than what is uſually made uſe of in our Climate.</p>

The Reſult of which was, that the Water dropp'd out of the lower Leg of the Syphon, as if it had been expos'd to the open Air; till the Receiver was in ſome meaſure exhauſted, and then ſeveral Bubbles ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in the Water, gather'd together at the Top of the ſhort leg'd Syphon, where expanding themſelves, they ſtopp'd the Courſe of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; that in the longer Leg being ſuſpended in the Tube and ceaſing to drop; and the Water in the ſhorter Leg, was ſo far depreſs'd, as not to be above a Foot high: But as ſoon as the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Air was let in again, it enter'd in at the ſmall Orifice of the longer Tube; and, aſcending through the Water contain'd in the Pipe, joyn'd with the former, which was lodg'd in the upper Part of the ſhort leg'd Tube.</p>
                        <p>But, to prevent what Inconveniences enſu'd the riſing of theſe Bubbles, the two foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Tubes, were placed ſo, as to meet in the middle of a Glaſs Viol, the Neck of the Viol being clos'd up with Cement; and the Tubes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus fix'd, and they, as well as the Viol, fill'd with Water, the Syphon repreſented by the <hi>Fifth Figure</hi> was plac'd in the Receiver with its
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:59609:208"/>ſhorter Leg in a Veſſel of Water, upon which the Pump being ply'd, the longer Syphon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd to drop much longer than before; but at the laſt, the Bubbles which roſe in the Pipes, were ſo dilated in the Viol, as to preſs down into the Ends of the Tube, and interrupt our Experiment, tho' what we obſerv'd gave us Reaſon to believe, that the Air contributed to the Motion of the Water through the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phons.</p>
                        <p>And here, I ſhall ſubjoyn, that I once had a very ſlender Pipe, which when held upon the Surface of the Water in a Perpendicular Poſture, the Incumbent <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> preſs'd ſo much more on the Surface of the External Water, than that contain'd in the Tube, that the Water was rais'd in the Tube; and this Pipe being bent into a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon, and plac'd with the ſhorter Leg in Water as Syphons uſually are, the Water, of its own accord, roſe up in the ſhorter Leg, and ran down the other; and this Syphon being plac'd in our Receiver, to try what Alteration of the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> would appear there, we could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern any ſenſible one. But tho' in this Tube juſt now mention'd, the Water riſes of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord; yet, if ſuch a Tube be thruſt a little way into the Mercury, inſtead of riſing, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury in the Tube will be below that which is without it.</p>

                           </note>But once having caus'd the Pump to be ply'd longer than ordinary, the Air contain'd in a Glaſs Bubble expanded it ſelf ſo powerfully, as to cauſe the ſides of it to fly in pieces; which is a ſtrong Argument of the Cloſeneſs of the Pores of the Glaſs, which are too fine to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Air to paſs through them. And for a further Proof of the imperviouſneſs of Glaſs, even by ſo minute Particles as thoſe of the Air, I ſhall add; that in all the Tryals I ever made, I but once found that a Spirit whoſe Parts are much more ſubtle and volatile than Air; I ſay, I but once found that a Spirit drawn from a Subſtance abounding with volatile Salts, and ſubtle Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, made way through the Pores of the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which unuſual <hi>Phenomenon</hi> probably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the brisk Agitation of thoſe ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Parts, encreas'd by the more than ordinary Heat with which they were rais'd; for the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them was ſo violent, as to fill the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and almoſt burſt it with their impetuous Steams; ſo that the Pores of the Glaſs being open'd with the violent Heat, ſeveral of them
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:59609:210"/>penetrated thoſe Pores, and appear'd on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the Glaſs.</p>

And the Inability of Air to paſs through ſuch Pores, which Water will readily enough, will be further evinc'd, by holding Water in a Tube, the lower End of which being very narrow, and perforated with a Pore no longer than a Hair; for the Water will readily paſs through it; but if the Tube be inverted, the Water in the narrower End of that Pipe will be ſuſpended, as if the End were wholly unperfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; the Air not being able to get through ſo ſmall a Paſſage: And that Water will paſs through Pores, which Air will not, may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evinc'd, by putting a little <hi>Alkalizate Salt</hi> into a Lamb's Bladder; for by wetting the End of the Bladder on the outſide, the Water paſſing through it's Pores, will preſently diſſolve that Salt.</p>

                           </note>Having ſaid thus much about the Weight of the Air, it may perhaps be expected, that I ſhould, by the Aſſiſtance of the Obſervations already deliver'd, determine the Height of the <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> from whence the Preſſure of the Air proceeds: But tho' it may be no difficult Task to ſhew, that the Accounts given by others are falſe; yet it is not altogether eaſie to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine a Controverſie, in which the Truth is ſo
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:59609:211"/>hard to be aſſign'd; and therefore, I ſhall only lay down ſomething in order to the Elucidation of it.</p>
                        <p>And firſt, it is neceſſary to take Notice, that the Weight of an equal Proportion of Air and Water about <hi>London</hi> is agreed on to be as 1000 to 1.</p>

                           <note place="margin">See Plate the Firſt.</note> which being partly fill'd with Quickſilver, and held in ſuch a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, that the Superficies of the Quickſilver in each Leg was in a Horizontal Line, E.

                        <p>Beſides this, we took another Method, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcover the Proportion of theſe two Liquors, by weighing them in a Glaſs Bubble; by which we found, that it was as 1 to 13 19/28; and becauſe Spirit of Wine is uſually eſteem'd the lighteſt of Liquors, and Quickſilver the heavieſt, I
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:59609:212"/>weigh'd that likewiſe, and found the Proportion of Quickſilver, and it, to be as 1 to 16 641/1084.

For,</p>

                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> We found, That the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> might as well be exhibited by a Candle-light or Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and however ſituated, ſo that the Rays of Light could but fall upon the Receiver.</p>

                           <hi>Next,</hi> The Flaſh appears juſt when the Key is turn'd to let the Air out into the Cylinder; but the ſame <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> would appear in a ſmall one upon drawing the Sucker haſtily down, tho' the Key was turn'd before; and it was further to be obſerv'd, That the Flaſhes, which appear'd when firſt the Receiver began to be exhauſted, were much ſtronger than when it was further evacuated.</p>
                        <p>And it was beſides obſervable, That when the Experiment was made in the ſmall Receiver, and the Sucker had not been long before well oyl'd; the Oyl, upon the drawing of it down, being put into Agitation, and divided into ſmall Parts by the Attrition of the Pump, would riſe into the Receiver like Smoak; which would likewiſe flow out of the Valve, when it was open'd on purpoſe; and theſe Fumes, if the Glaſs was held in a light Place, would in ſome

We ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the following Conjectures, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, That had the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> conſtantly ſucceeded, we ſhould have ſuſpected the ſeeming Light to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from ſome Refractions from the Glaſs darkned within by thoſe white Steams. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That, ſince the Air abounds with Parts groſs enough to appear in the Sun-beams, and to reflect the Rays of Light, which riſe from Bonfires, the Reflection might proceed from ſome groſs Airy Parts within the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Thirdly, The Whiteneſs ſeem'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the various Surfaces of the airy Parts, reflecting one upon another like Looking-glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſo as to repreſent each other contiguous; ſo Water or Eggs beaten to Froth, loſe their Tranſparency, and appear white: But further having immers'd the Neck of our Receiver in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſet the Pump on work; the Water being drawn in through a ſmall Hole, had its Parts ſo bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that the Receiver appear'd full of Milk rather than Water: And if a Piece of Cryſtal be thrown very hot into cold Water, it will crack, and having ſo many new Surfaces within appears white.</p>
                        <p>Which Things being conſider'd and weigh'd, it may not be an improbable Gueſs, That the aforementioned <hi>Phaenomena</hi> proceeded from the Parts of the Air diſplac'd as to their Poſture and
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:59609:214"/>Situation, as, whilſt in that Motion, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb their former Continuity and Tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency.</p>
                        <p>And this Conjecture may be made probable by obſerving, That the more Air was included, the more conſpicuous was the Whiteneſs; but more eſpecially by this, <hi>viz.</hi> That having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted the Receiver, and apply'd a Glaſs Bubble to the Hole in the Stop-cock, ſo that there might be a Communication betwixt the Cavity of the Receiver, and it, upon the Exſuction of the Air out of the Receiver, the Air in the Bubble was ſo diſorder'd, by ſo ſudden a Diſilition of it's Parts, that it appear'd like Milk; but upon a ſudden Re-ingreſs of the Air, became tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent again.</p>
                        <p>But if it ſhould be objected, That the White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Water turn'd into Bubbles may proceed from the Interpoſition of ſo Heterogeneous a Body as Air; I ſhould anſwer, That I have in another Place mentioned two volatile Liquors, which being mix'd produce a white conſiſtent Body, though both the Ingredients were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent.</p>
                        <p>But having convey'd ſome Smoak into our Receiver, and obſerv'd upon plying of the Pump, That the Air remaining in the Pump, became opacous; we ſuſpected, that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the former mentioned Light ſometimes appear'd and ſometimes did not, might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from ſome Parts of Matter ſwimming in the Air more at one time than another, which was diſpos'd, more to cauſe ſuch Reflections of the Rays of Light as to afford the fore-named <hi>Phaenomenon;</hi> which is rendred probable by
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:59609:214"/>obſerving, That the Receiver appear'd opaque when the Smoak ſettl'd about the Sides of it; and it may further be illuſtrated by what we mentioned before of our ſmoaking Liquor, where the Corpuſcles of it being put into a new Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion became opacous inſtead of tranſparent.</p>
                        <p>And if it ſhould be asked, How the Air ſhould abound with ſuch various Parts of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? I muſt anſwer, That it is not an unuſual Obſervation, That the Air undergoes ſeveral and very frequent Changes; for beſides ſeveral Inſtances which might be added, the Learned <hi>Joſephus Acoſta</hi> obſerves, That in <hi>America, There are Winds which naturally trouble the Water of the Sea, and make it Green and Black; others, clear as Cryſtal.</hi> Beſides we obſerv'd, That the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dula as well as Scales ſuſpended in our Receiver, loſt a great deal of their Brightneſs, upon draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out and letting in the Air. And I once made a Tincture of a certain Metalline Subſtance, which would become turbid and clear ſucceſſively, for ſeveral times, for which ſtrange <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> no Reaſon could be given.</p>

                        <p>HAving made theſe <hi>Experiments</hi> relating to Reſpiration, it may perhaps be expected that I ſhould ſay ſomething concerning the Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Air in Reſpiration. In doing of which, it is not requiſite that I ſhould take Notice of the Structure of thoſe Parts, ſince they have been ſufficiently deſcrib'd already. Nor ſhall I any further engage in that Controverſy, Whether the Motion of the <hi>Lungs</hi> depends on the Motion
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:59609:217"/>of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> or not, or how the <hi>Lungs</hi> are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtended by the Air, any further than it may be Illuſtrated by our <hi>Engin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As for the Firſt Part of the Controverſy, it ſeems to be determin'd in favour of the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, by what the Learned Dr. <hi>Highmore,</hi> and <hi>Bartholinus</hi> have obſerv'd; the former having taken Notice, That the <hi>Lungs</hi> ſubſide, if the <hi>Intercoſtal</hi> Muſcles be ſo wounded, as to lay the <hi>Thorax</hi> open; and the latter having obſerv'd the ſame upon a Diviſion of the <hi>Diaphragm:</hi> But what it is that conveighs the Air into the <hi>Lungs,</hi> is yet undetermin'd; ſince ſome think it to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Dilatation of the <hi>Thorax</hi> impelling the Air contiguous, and what it contiguous to that, ſucceſſively into the <hi>Lungs:</hi> But this Suppoſition is fairly anſwer'd, ſince it is poſſible to breathe out of a Glaſs, where the External Air preſs'd on by the <hi>Thorax,</hi> can only preſs on the outſide of the Bottle. But a more eaſy Solution may be taken from our <hi>Engin,</hi> ſince it appears, That if the <hi>Lungs</hi> be dilated by the <hi>Thorax,</hi> the Spring of the Air is ſufficient to force it in, there being leſs Reſiſtence made by the Rarify'd Air in the <hi>Lungs,</hi> than that in the open <hi>Atmoſphere.</hi> And tho' there are ſome Obſervations, which teſtify, that when the <hi>Diaphragm</hi> hath been conſiderably wounded, without damaging Reſpiration, yet ſince the <hi>Lungs</hi> are void of Muſculous Parts to dilate themſelves, we are rather inclin'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they are dilated by the Expaſion of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> and fill'd by the Gravity, and Preſſure of the <hi>Atmoſphere.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But to proceed to the Uſe of Air in Reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, beſides the Uſefulneſs of it in Modulating
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:59609:217"/>Sounds, and the Conveying of Odours, it is beyond Doubt, That it is in a great Meaſure ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the Preſervation of Life, tho' as to the Manner of it's Contributing to the Continuance of Life, ſeveral diſagree; ſince it is by ſome thought only to keep the Blood from growing too hot in the Ventricles of the Heart. But that this is not all that the Air, in Reſpiration, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms, is evident, ſince not only Old People, but ſeveral Creatures, have no need of Cooling their Blood and Humours being cold enough without it, yet they cannot live without Reſpiration.</p>
                        <p>Others hold that the Air being convey'd into the Left Ventricle of the Heart, contributes to the Generation of Spirits; but ſince there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears no ſuch Paſſages, as are fit for it's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance, we ſhall not here recite what other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments might be alledg'd againſt it.</p>
                        <p>But others, as <hi>Moebius</hi> and <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> are of Opinion, that it chiefly ſerves to Ventilate and Carry off the Excrement of the Blood; for as a Candle may be extinguiſh'd by it's own Smoak; ſo the Heat of the Blood might be prejudic'd, were not it's Fuliginous Recrement carry'd off, by mixing with the Air upon Inſpiration. Which is Congruous enough, to what hath been obſerv'd by ſeveral Travellers; <hi>viz,</hi> That there is a certain Conſiſtence requiſite in the Air, to carry off ſuch Fumes; for it is obſerv'd, That if the Air drawn in, be too much impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with Vapours, as in ſome Cellars, when Damps ariſe in Mines, it becomes ſo unfit to Breathe, as to ſtifle thoſe that do not avoid the Latter, or uſe ſome Method to rarify it, as by holding a Chaffing-diſh of Coals near
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:59609:218"/>their Faces, to diſperſe and ſcatter thoſe Fumes. And to confirm theſe Obſervations, I ſhall add, That having clos'd a Bird in our Receiver, I obſerv'd, that the Air being thicken'd by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Reſpirations, it began in a little time to pant and gape, and at the laſt grew ſo ſick, as to throw foul Matter off it's Stomach; and in 3 Quarters of an Hour to be ready to die: And that the Receiver ſhould be ſo fill'd with Steams, needs not ſeem a Wonder, to any one that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders, what <hi>Sanctorious</hi> hath obſerv'd, <hi>viz.</hi> That the greateſt Part of our Aliment is carry'd off, by Inſenſible Tranſpiration.</p>
                        <p>And as theſe Inſtances ſhew, how unfit an Air too groſs, is for Reſpiration; ſo that an Air too thin is likewiſe prejudicial, appears from the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments</hi> already try'd in our Receiver; ſo that it is not Improbable that if a Man were remov'd to the Top of our <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> he would die for want of Breath.</p>
                        <p>In favour of which Conjecture, I ſhall add, That the Learned <hi>Joſephus Acoſta,</hi> tells us, that going up a high Mountain in <hi>Peru,</hi> call'd <hi>Pariacaca,</hi> which was ſo high above the <hi>Alps,</hi> as to make them appear only as high Towers, he and his Companion were taken with exceſſive Vomiting, together with Blood, which laſted till he came to a Region more convenient for Reſpiration; and he likewiſe ſays, to our preſent Purpoſe, <hi>That the Element of the Air is ſo ſubtle and delicate there, that it is too fine for a Man to breathe in; the Action of Reſpiration, requiring a groſſer and more temperate Air.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But tho' from hence it appears, that the Air contributes to Reſpiration, in carrying off the
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:59609:218"/>Recrements of the Blood; yet it is ſcarce pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that thoſe Recrements ſhould ſo ſoon kill an Animal, as to cauſe Birds inclos'd in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, to die in a few Minutes, for want of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carry'd off. And it would not be harder to account for ſuch Effects, ſhould we allow with <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> That Air contributed to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of a Vital Spirit; ſince the Interruption of it's Generation, for ſo ſmall a time could ſcarce be fatal.</p>
                        <p>Yet I ſhall add on this occaſion, That I have been told, that <hi>Cornelius Drebellus,</hi> made a Boat for the Learned King <hi>James,</hi> which would ſwim under Water, in which, to make the Air inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded fit for Reſpiration, he was wont to open a Veſſel which contain'd a Liquor, which added ſuch a Vital Spirit to the Air, as purg'd it of the groſſer Exhalations, and condens'd them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am the more favourably inclin'd to think that the Air may conduce to the Preſervrtion of Vital Spirits; and that it contributes to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Life, as Air to Flame; for having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd rectfy'd Spirit of Wine into our Receiver, we found, that it would not continue long, no more than the Vital Flame of an Animal, if the Air was exhauſted.</p>
                        <p>But not to inſiſt upon theſe things, we ſhall add, That having diſſected a Bitch, and taking out one of the Whelps, tho' we open'd his <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen,</hi> and <hi>Thorax,</hi> and divided the <hi>Diaphragm;</hi> yet having once began to breathe, his Heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd to beat above ſix Hours; whereas three more, which were involv'd in the <hi>Secundines,</hi> in the mean time, were all dead; tho' they were neither wounded, nor had ever breath'd. How far
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:59609:219"/>this may ſerve to illuſtrate the <hi>Problem</hi> propos'd by Dr. <hi>Harvey, viz.</hi> Why a <hi>Foetus</hi> may live lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger before it hath breath'd, if involv'd in the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundines,</hi> than if, when it hath once reſpired, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration be ſtopp'd, we leave others to judge.</p>
                        <p>Whether Fiſhes breathe or not, under Water, eſpecially thoſe that want <hi>Lungs,</hi> I cannot now determine; but that Air is neceſſary to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of their Lives, ſeems to be evinc'd, by obſerving, that if Fiſhes be inclos'd in a Bottle, which is cloſe ſtopp'd from the Air; or if they be kept from the Air by the Freezing of Water, they preſently die. And indeed, conſidering how many Particles of Air are interſpers'd in the Pores of Water, it may not be altogether impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that part of it is ſeparated, as it paſſes through their Gills, or ſome other way: And I am the rather inclin'd to believe it, becauſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put a large Eel into our Receiver, upon exhauſting the Air, ſhe turn'd up her Belly, and lay as dead, till the Receiver being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopp'd, and the Fiſh taken out into the open Air, ſatisfy'd us of her Recovery, by very brisk and vivid Motions. But what is not a little to be admir'd, having put a Gray Snail into our Receiver, we perceiv'd not the leaſt Alteration, when the Air was drawn out; but whence theſe <hi>Phaenomena</hi> proceeded, we ſhall not now ſtay to determine.</p>

And it is not unworthy our Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, That Inſects which want <hi>Lungs,</hi> are no leſs ſenſibly affected upon the Exſuction of Air, than ſome that have them, which may be Grounds for a Suſpicion, that the Particles of the Air enter in at their Pores, and that it keeps them alive by a Univerſal Perſpiration.</p>

                     <p>THIS Chapter containing the Honourable Author's Vindication of his own <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> concerning the Weight and Spring of the Air: It will not be requiſite here to lay down, all the trivial Objections of <hi>Franciſcus Linus;</hi> which are eaſily anſwer'd, by any one that hath but read and conſider'd the Author's <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> and will at the firſt ſight appear to be ill-ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or invalid Arguments, or rather falſe Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſms: But, it being more conſiſtent with the deſign'd Epitomy, I ſhall only take notice of ſuch, as may ſerve to illuſtrate the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready laid down, and think it unneceſſary to fill an Epitomy with, what our judicious Author did not repute as Arguments againſt his Doctrin: And eſpecially, becauſe the Learn'd World, by their General Conſent have agreed upon what the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Author hath taught: Wherefore I ſhall lay down only thoſe Objections which may ſeem conſiderable, and annex their Solutions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The first Argument of <hi>Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Linus</hi> Anſwer'd.</note>The firſt Argument alledg'd by <hi>Franciſcus Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> is, That, did the Suſpenſion of the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> in the Cylinder, depend on the <hi>Aequilibri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> of the Weight of the <hi>Atmoſphere;</hi> when a Cylinder is fill'd full and inverted, upon an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Tube, and a Subtraction of the lower Finger, the <hi>Mercury</hi> would not ſubſide,
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:59609:222"/>were its deſcent not promoted by the Dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Air above the <hi>Mercury;</hi> for if it were, that Expanſive Force would raiſe the Finger upon the upper Orifice of the Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                     <p>To which is anſwer'd, That the included Air may depreſs the <hi>Mercury</hi> by it's Expanſion down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, without raiſing the Finger; for the Weight of the whole Cylindrical Pillar of the <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> which preſſes upon the top of the Finger, being too ſtrong to be overpower'd by the weak Expanſion of the Air in the Pipe, it muſt conſequently preſs downwards, where the Weight of the <hi>Mercury</hi> is ready to joyn with it to over-balance the Preſſure of the Air, which before buoy'd it up: And that the Weight of the Cylinder of <hi>Mercury</hi> diſpoſes it to ſpend its expanſive Force downwards, appears from a Cylinder of Water ſuſpended inſtead of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury;</hi> for the Weight of that being not able to reſiſt the Preſſure of the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> downwards, equally as the <hi>Mercury;</hi> the Air in the Top of the Cylinder does not preſs it down near ſo far: And tho' the Objector ſays, that if Water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Air be above the <hi>Mercury,</hi> it will not ſubſide; the Reaſon of that is only, becauſe the Water wants a Springineſs to expand it ſelf: And as for the Reaſon why the Pulp of the Finger ſeems to be drawn down into the Tube, that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happens, by Reaſon of the Weight of the Incumbent <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> the Rarifi'd Air within, not being able to make an equal Reſiſtance to prevent the Finger from being preſs'd into the Pipe: And tho the Objector further urges, that he cannot conceive how the Air can be ſo expand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:59609:222"/>without poſſeſſing a greater Space, we have ſufficiently clear'd that, by comparing the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion of the Air's Spring to a piece of Wooll ſqueez'd together, which when it is no longer Compreſs'd, dilates it ſelt by Virtue of its ſpringy Parts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">A ſnd Objection.</note>The ſecond Objection is, That if <hi>Mercury</hi> be ſuſpended in a long Pipe, about 40 Inches long, when the Tube is inverted, and the Finger is taken from the lower Orifice, it falls down till it comes to its uſual Station; and the Pulp of the Finger is equally depreſs'd into the Tube; which evinces, that the <hi>Mercury</hi> is ſuſpended by a <hi>Funiculus,</hi> which draws down the Pulpy Part of the Finger.</p>
                     <p>But, what Anſwer is to be given to this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer'd. </seg>
                        </label> appears from what hath been ſaid to the former; for the <hi>Mercury</hi> ſubſiding, till it came to an <hi>Aequilibrium</hi> with the <hi>Atmoſphere;</hi> the Air above it being very much Rarifi'd, and unable to buoy up againſt the Finger; the Depreſſion of the Pulp of it muſt proceed from the Weight of the incumbent <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> tho' the ſwelling of the Pulp in the Pipe might perhaps partly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from an Expanſion of the Humours within the Subſtance of it, the Weight of the <hi>Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere</hi> being prevented from ſqueezing upon it by the Equivalent Weight of the <hi>Mercury.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">A third. Objection anſwer'd.</note>Another Objection is, That if a Tube twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Inches long, be immers'd in Quickſilver, and when it is full, the upper Orifice of it be ſtopp'd with ones Finger, as well as the lower, upon taking away the lower Finger, the Pulp of the upper will be drawn down, tho' the Weight of the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> is ſaid to be able to buoy up a Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:59609:223"/>much longer; So that this is a plain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the Suſpenſion of the <hi>Mercury</hi> by a <hi>Funiculus,</hi> and that it is not buoy'd up by the Preſſure of the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> according to the Elateriſts.</p>
                     <p>But tho' this Objection may ſeem to repreſent ſome Difficulty, yet it will eaſily be anſwer'd, by thus explaining the <hi>Phaenomenon, viz.</hi> Tho' when the Tube is ſtopp'd at both Ends, the Finger upon the Top of the Tube be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually preſ'sd upon on both ſides; yet, upon a Removal of the Finger below, tho' the Preſſure of the Air upon the Finger continu'd to be the ſame, yet the Preſſure of the <hi>Mercury</hi> is by two Thirds leſs, againſt the Pulp of the Finger, its Gravity preſſing upon the ſubjacent Air; for notwithſtanding the Air is able to buoy up a greater Quantity, yet that in Part takes off the full Preſſure of it, ſo as to make the Preſſure upwards, diſproportionable to that which tends downwards: And tho' the Objector urges, that the <hi>Mercury</hi> is equally ſuſpended upon a Remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of the Finger, as before; I anſwer, that the Finger preſſes it up much more ſtrongly, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any of it getting out; whereas the Preſſure of the Air only depends on the Weight of it, which cannot be intended or weaken'd, as that of the Finger may, which is capable of raiſing a much greater Weight.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Another Objection anſwer'd.</note>Another Objection alledg'd by the Author is, that were the <hi>Mercury</hi> buoy'd up by the Weight of the <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> it would be as eaſy to ſuck up <hi>Mercury</hi> in a Pipe as Water, nothing more being requiſite but to draw away the Air.</p>
                     <pb n="397" facs="tcp:59609:223"/>
                     <p>But this may eaſily be taken off by conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Dilatation of the Lungs depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon an Ingreſs of Air upon the Motion of the <hi>Diaphragm</hi> and Intercoſtal Muſcles, and that Air being preſs'd in by the Gravity of the Air and it's Spring, it will follow, that that Gravity or Spring being more powerfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by the Cylinder of <hi>Mercury</hi> than Water, the Lungs cannot ſo powerfully dilate; nor can the <hi>Mercury</hi> be rais'd with equal eaſe, becauſe, that Air in the Lungs, together with the Weight of the <hi>Mercury,</hi> brings the External Force of the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> nearer to an <hi>Aequilibrium.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the External Air preſſing upon the <hi>Thorax,</hi> and keeping them from dilating themſelves, the Air contain'd in them, preſſing againſt the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of the <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Tube, is a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cauſe, why it riſes not ſo high; which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation is confirm'd by obſerving, that as the Lungs are more violently dilated, the <hi>Mercury</hi> riſes higher in the Tube; and it will be further Probable, by conſidering, how much greater a Preſſure may be made upon ſo large a Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies as that of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> than can be reſiſted by the Rarifi'd Air in the Lungs. And as for the <hi>Funiculus,</hi> which our Author ſuppoſes to raiſe the <hi>Mercury,</hi> by contracting it ſelf; it would not be a little ſtrange, that it ſhould raiſe ſuch a Weight as a Cylinder of <hi>Mercury,</hi> without tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the thin Membranes of the Lungs to which ſuch a <hi>Funiculus</hi> muſt, at one end be joyn'd.</p>
                     <p>To theſe Objections the Author adds an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that if the Spring of the Air be of no Force, <hi>in loco aperto,</hi> no more can be effected by
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:59609:224"/>it <hi>in loco Clauſo;</hi> but the Place which the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor takes to be <hi>in loco Clauſo,</hi> appearing to be only in a Room; It is anſwer'd, that whereas the former Objectoins appear to be invalid, the Inference muſt be ſo too; becauſe there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Communication betwixt the Air in a Room and the External, by ſome Holes or Crannies, or otherwiſe, the included Air will be able to do as much by its Spring, within as without.</p>

                     <p>THE <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> laid down by our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and which is now to be examin'd,<note place="margin">Arguments in favour of the Funi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis</hi> exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd.</note> is, That what we aſcribe to the Spring and Weight of the Air is done by a ſort of <hi>Funiculus,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of a thin Subſtance powerfully expanded, which being betwix two Bodies, endeavours to contract it ſelf, and to bring thoſe Bodies toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>ne detur Vacuum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt Argument alledg'd, is, That the Finger would not be ſo drawn down by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of the <hi>Mercury,</hi> were there not a <hi>Funicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus;</hi> and that were there not a thin Subſtance there extended, there would be a <hi>Vacuum,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the firſt Part of the Argument, it hath already been anſwer'd in the foregoing Chapter. And tho' he alledg'd the Neceſſity of ſuch a <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niculus</hi> from Nature's Abhorrency of a <hi>Vacuum;</hi> the firſt Argument he offers, being deduced from the Suction of the Pulp of the Finger upon the
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:59609:224"/>Deſcent of the <hi>Mercury,</hi> It is likewiſe already An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd by what hath gone before in Explaining that <hi>Phaenomenon.</hi> But another Argument he alledges againſt a Vacuity is, the Diaphaneity of that Part of the Tube; for were there a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> he ſays it would be like a black Pillar, neither capable of affording any thing viſible, nor of permitting viſible Objects to appear through it: But the Invalidity of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will appear from the Doctrin of the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureans</hi> and <hi>Atomists,</hi> who Teach, that Light is made up of ſuch ſubtle Emanations, as are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of penetrating Glaſs it ſelf, and tho' the Cavity of the Cylinder may ſeem full of Light; yet no doubt, but were the Parts of luciferous Matter condenſed into a Lump, they would not fill half the Cavity; ſince the Smoak which fill'd up the Cavity of our Receiver, ſo as to make it appear Opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous, was but capable of filling a ſmall part of it, when condens'd. Beſides, ſhould the <hi>Torre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellian</hi> Experiment be made in the Dark, a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuiſt might argue, that the Matter, which upon an Acceſs of Light was viſible, was not in the Receiver before, but proceeded only from the Rays of Light darting through the Glaſs: And tho' Light ſhould not be caus'd by a Trajection of ſuch luciferous Beams, but from an Impulſe of luciferous Bodies; yet would it not thence follow, that the Tube was full; ſince from our ſeventeenth Experiment it appear'd, that when the Receiver was in a great meaſure exhauſted, there remain'd a ſufficient Quantity of Matter behind, to communicate a tremulous Motion to the External Air: And tho' it ſhould be allow'd, that the Cavity of the Tube were fill'd with the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſian
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:59609:225"/>
                        <hi>Materia ſubtilis;</hi> yet, ſince they allow that capable of paſſing in and out upon the Acceſs of a groſſer Body, it would not be any more to his Purpoſe, in maintaining his Funicular <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> or oppoſing Ours, becauſe ſuch a Body as ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily paſſes in and out, will be as ready to give way to the Motion of a more groſs Body, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to the riſing or ſubſiding of the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another Argument alledg'd in Favour of the Funicular <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> is, that when the <hi>Mercury</hi> is ſubſided to its wonted Station, it gravitates no farther. But it being already ſhewn, why it does not, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe it is counterbalanc'd by an equal Weight or Preſſure made by the <hi>Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere,</hi> what hath gone before hath been a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Anſwer. And if it ſhould be ask'd, why, when the Finger is preſs'd upon, by a Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder of the <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> and at the ſame time by a Cylinder of the <hi>Mercury</hi> on the other fide, it feels no ſenſible Pain; it may be anſwer'd, that the Preſſure being equal on each ſide, the Senſe of Preſſure is the leſs perceptible; which is confirm'd by what divers obſerve at a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble depth under Water, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are not ſenſible of it.</p>
                     <p>And if it ſhould be further ask'd, why upon the Deſcent of the <hi>Mercury,</hi> it, at the firſt, falls ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing below its wonted Station, and preſently riſes up again, it may be anſwer'd, that that proceeds from an <hi>Impetus</hi> acquir'd by its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent, which at the firſt partly overpowers the Spring of the Air below it; but that <hi>Impetus</hi> being quaſh'd, the Spring and Weight of the Air preſently weighs it up again to its uſual Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:59609:225"/>and having been put into a little more than ordinary Compreſſion, raiſes it ſomething higher; ſo that the <hi>Impetus</hi> upon a ſecond De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent brings on a ſucceſſive Elevation, till at the laſt the <hi>Impetus</hi> on each ſide gradually is loſt, and diſcontinues that vibrating Motion; and this may not only be illuſtrated by the ſucceſſive Vibrations of a Pair of Scales put in Motion by depreſſing one and elevating the other; but was farther confirmed by <hi>Mercury</hi> in a Glaſs Tube, made uſe of in our 36th Experiment, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put a Quantity of <hi>Mercury</hi> into it, and by inclining of it permitted it to run into one Leg, I ſtopp'd the Orifice of the other with my Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, upon which, the Tube being erected, the Air contained in the Syphon, which was ſtopp'd at the Top, depreſs'd the <hi>Mercury</hi> in that Tube; but as ſoon as it was unſtopp'd, the vibrating Motions of the <hi>Mercury</hi> began and continu'd to riſe and fall ſucceſſively for ſome time.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> A Continuation of <hi>Objections</hi> againſt the <hi>Funicular Hypotheſis.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>BESIDES the forementioned Objections, there are ſeveral others which perplex the Funi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Hypotheſis:</hi> As firſt, How the ſuperficial Parts of two ſolid Marbles, which adhere toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when exactly poliſhed, can be drawn out into a <hi>Funiculus;</hi> a Difficulty which does not at
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:59609:226"/>all perplex our Doctrin. Beſides, were the Funicular <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> allowed, it might be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned, How it comes to paſs, that Liquors whoſe Parts are not equally liable to be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into ſuch <hi>Funiculus</hi>'s ſhould exactly ſubſide till Aequiponderant to 29 ½ Inches of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and no further; an Objection which our Doctrin admits not of, ſince not only from Wind-Guns, but our former Experiments, it appears too manifeſtly to doubt of the Air's Spring and Gravity.</p>
                     <p>Nor is the Author's ſtrange Method of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing his <hi>Funiculus</hi> leſs exceptionable; for he ſays, When the <hi>Mercury</hi> touches the Top of the Tube, upon it's Deſcent, it leaves it's Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies to ſtick to the Top of it, which is extended by the Weight of the <hi>Mercury,</hi> till it leaves another Superficies joyning to that; where it may be objected, That neither Senſe perceives any ſuch Thing, nor can it be made probable by Reaſon; it being impoſſible to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, How the Superficies of a Body can be ſo extended as to become a Body it ſelf: And ſhould it be allowed, that the <hi>Funiculus</hi> might be turned into ſo ſubtle a Body, it would be altogether inconceivable how it ſhould be ſo firm and ſtrong, as to ſuſpend the Weight of a Cylinder of <hi>Mercury;</hi> and that it ſhould have ſuch an admirable Property as to extend without being made thinner, contrary to the Nature of all Ropes.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, the Method he takes to illuſtrate his Generation of the <hi>Funiculus,</hi> by comparing it to the Flame of a Candle, does not enforce the Belief of it any more; for not to urge, That
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:59609:226"/>the Parts of a Candle, are by Agitation, and a powerful Motion amongſt each other, kept at ſuch a diſtance, as to leave ſeveral and a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Vacuities betwixt their Parts; if the Rarefaction of the <hi>Mercury</hi> in the <hi>Funiculus</hi> be like that, when it is rais'd in the Form of a Vapour, it would be too ſlight to ſuſpend a Tube of <hi>Mercury.</hi> And it might be further demanded, How the <hi>Funiculus</hi> came by ſuch Hooks, as to take hold of every Body contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to them, ſo firmly, as to be able to break ſtrong Glaſſes, by drawing their ſides inwards; and how Fluids ſhould be ſo ſuſpended, as to appear one entire Piece, contrary to what their Fluidity diſpoſes them to do. Nor is it leſs ſtrange, That our Objector ſhould allow this ſubtle Body a Spring which he denies to be in Air; ſince Nature's Abhorrency of a <hi>Vacuum</hi> cannot be the Cauſe of it, in as much as a <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum</hi> would not enſue, according to his Doctrin, tho' it were not contracted.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, it would not be a little hard to conceive, were ſuch a <hi>Funiculus</hi> allowed of, how the Surfaces of Marbles extended, could contract into Marbles again; and how in the Cylinder of <hi>Mercury,</hi> the <hi>Funiculus</hi> is ſo eaſily relaxed, upon an Admiſſion of Air into it, ſince, it filling up all the Space above the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> before, it cannot eaſily be conceiv'd how it ſhould be diſpoſſeſs'd of that Space, without being thruſt into another.</p>
                     <p>Again, I ſhould be glad to know, if the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of our Receiver, upon an Exſuction of Air, were fill'd with ſuch ſtretched Strings, it would be poſſible for a Pendulum to move in it without
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:59609:227"/>breaking them; but our Author's <hi>Funiculus</hi> being made up of Strings, endued with pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Qualities, we ſhall decline making any more Objections, ſince theſe Peculiarities may be ſufficient to diſtinguiſh it from Truth.</p>

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telian</hi> Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</note>BESIDES the former Objections which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Funicular Doctrin unintelligible, there are yet others, upon the Account of the Doctrin of Rarefaction employed in the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating of it.</p>
                     <p>For the Doctrine of Rarefaction made uſe of by our Author, ſuppoſing a Body not only to fill up a larger Space, when rarified, but likewiſe ſo to fill it, as not to leave the leaſt Vacuities betwixt it's Parts; it will be very hard to conceive, How a Hundred Parts of Matter, which are circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by ſo many Spaces of the ſame Extenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with themſelves, ſhould be capable of filling up more Space adaequately than they are circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by, without the Addition of other Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and it ſeems ſtrange, That without the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Act of Omnipotence, Matter ſhould be ſo extended as without any Addition to alter it's Dimenſions.</p>
                     <p>And tho' our Author takes two Ways to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate his Notion, either upon a Suppoſition of the Parts of Matter being indiviſible or diviſible <hi>in infinitum;</hi> yet, ſince he explicates it neither
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:59609:227"/>of thoſe ways ſo clearly, as to make it intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, I muſt confeſs, I cannot acquieſce in them; nor are the Difficulties at all made leſs by aſſerting, That Matter may be virtually ſo extended as to poſſeſs more Space than is circumſcribed by it; ſince a virtual Extenſion is as unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as Extenſion without the Term virtually joyn'd with it; for ſince he ſeems to allow the Parts of Matter to be indiviſible, it rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices the Doctrin of Rarefaction as taught by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> than explains it; ſince it is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent to think, That a Body, whoſe Parts are circumſcribed by a certain Space, ſhould fill a larger Space, without being divided and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of the former.</p>
                     <p>Nor does it at all explain or render the <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telian</hi> Doctrin of Rarefaction, to ſay, That Matter may, by Omnipotence, be ſo ordered, as to poſſeſs adaequately double the Space it did before; ſince in Natural Philoſophy it is not diſputed what <hi>GOD</hi> can do, but what he hath done.</p>
                     <p>But beſides the Difficulties in our Author's Doctrin of Rarefaction, there are no leſs in the Condenſation which his <hi>Funiculus</hi> ſuppoſes; for ſince he allows of no Vacuities in it, it is impoſſible the Parts of it ſhould be brought nearer than to touch one another, without a Penetration of Dimenſions, which is wholly diſallow'd of, and by no means to be admitted in Nature; for were that allowed, two or three Thouſand Bodies might be contained in a Space, which every one of them by it ſelf would fill; which is altogether unintelligible.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>And Firſt: The Famous <hi>Pecquet</hi> mentions an <hi>Experiment,</hi> made by Monſieur <hi>Paſcal,</hi> at the Foot of a Mountain 3000 Foot high; where when he aſcended, 150 Fathom, the <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder was not buoy'd up ſo high, as at the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, by two Inches and a Quarter; and at the Top of the Hill, it wanted 3 Inches of that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which it was ſuſpended at, at the Foot of the Hill; which is a ſtrong Argument againſt our Adverſary; the Difference plainly appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to depend on the different Length of the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſpherical</hi> Cylinder, which was abler to weigh up the <hi>Mercury</hi> at the Bottom, than the Top of the Hill.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Gaſſendus, Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>P.</hi> 211. relates, that the like was obſerv'd 5 times on the Hills at <hi>Auvergne.</hi> And a very Noted Virtuoſo, Mr. <hi>J. Ball,</hi> as well as that Ingenious Gentleman Mr. <hi>Townley,</hi> have obſerv'd the like in <hi>England.</hi> And it was by the laſt nam'd, likewiſe obſerv'd, that the <hi>Mercury</hi> included in the Top of the Cylinder, was not able to depreſs the <hi>Mercury,</hi> near ſo much at the Bottom, as at the Top of the Hill.</p>
                     <pb n="407" facs="tcp:59609:228"/>
                     <p>But to diſcover the weight of the Air, and it's Spring, without going up to the Top of ſuch high Mountains, we made uſe of the following Weather Glaſs, ſuſpending Water in the Pipe, inſtead of <hi>Mercury.</hi> The Inſtrument was a Glaſs with a broad Foot, and a narrow Neck (A B), and a ſlender Pipe of Glaſs (C D), which was open at both Ends; and ſo plac'd, that the lower End was not far from the Bottom (A B), and was ſo cloſely cemented at the Neck (A),<note place="margin">See <hi>Fig.</hi> the Firſt, <hi>Plate</hi> the Second.</note> as to prevent the Internal Air (I I) from communicating with External (K K), unleſs it were through the Pipe (C D). And having conveig'd Water (H H) into the Glaſs (AB), which was pretty large, and having blown ſo much Air into the Bottle, as to raiſe the Water in the Tube above the Veſſel, upon the Leads of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Abby. When the Air was thought to be equally Cold and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens'd within the Bottle, as without; we mark'd the Station of the Water (F), and letting it down by a String to the Ground, the Water ſubſided an Inch, where it's Station (E), being mark'd, and the Veſſel drawn up again, the Water was rais'd to the Mark (F) again. Which <hi>Experiment</hi> being again try'd, had the like ſucceſs. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the Top of the Tube being broke, we let it down within the Church, the Surface of the Water in the Pipe being at (G) an Inch above the Water in the Glaſs; where I obſerv'd, that the Air ſo depreſs'd it, when it came to the Bottom, as to force the Water out of the Pipe into the Glaſs, ſeveral Bubbles breaking through into the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Glaſs, and this Glaſs being drawn up to the Top of the Church again, the Water was manifeſtly rais'd in the Tube again; from whence
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:59609:229"/>it appears, that the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> gravitates more; <hi>Caeteris paribus,</hi> the nearer the Surface of the Earth; for the <hi>Experiment</hi> being repeated, we found that as the Height, at which it was try'd, vary'd; ſo the Elevation or Depreſſion did.</p>
                     <p>Another Particular which may be a further Confirmation of our <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> is, That which is mention'd by Monſieur <hi>Paſchal, viz.</hi> That a Foot-Ball being weakly blown, and carry'd to the Top of a Hill, ſwell'd more and more, as it was carry'd higher; and as gradually grew lank, when it was carry'd down the Hill again: From whence it appears, That as the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> is lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or ſhorter, it makes a greater Gravitation and Preſſure upon the Bladder.</p>
                     <p>To this I ſhall add an <hi>Experiment,</hi> ſent to Dr. <hi>Croon,</hi> by a Learned Profeſſor of <hi>Greſham</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,<note place="margin">See <hi>Fig.</hi> the Sec. <hi>Plate</hi> the Second.</note> which is the following: Having Obſerv'd that in the Weather-Glaſs (A B), repreſented by the Second <hi>Figure,</hi> which was about two Foot long; the Water was ſuſpended in the Pipe, about thirteen Inches above the Superficies of the External Water, at the Bottom of <hi>Hallifax</hi> Hill; but being carry'd to the Top of the Hill, it ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided an Inch and a Quarter, to the Point (D). The Internal Air (A C), which was taken in at the Bottom, dilating it ſelf at the Top further by (C D). In which <hi>Experiment,</hi> the Deſcent being much more conſiderable than what it ought to be in ſuch a ſmall Aſcent, by the bare Preſſure of the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> diminiſh'd, the Reaſon appears to be, the Expanſion of that Air included in the Top of the Weather-Glaſs; as well as the Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>Atmoſpherical</hi> Cylinder.</p>

                     <p>In which <hi>Experiment</hi> it is to be Noted, Firſt, That we made uſe of a Glaſs-Tube, about 6 Foot long, ſealed at one End.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, We had in Readineſs a Glaſs-Pipe, about the Diameter of a Swan's Quill, which was mark'd with a Paper ſtuck upon it, divided into Inches, and half Quarters; which being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers'd in the other Cylinder of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and open at both Ends, that the <hi>Mercury</hi> might riſe in it, it help'd to fill the other up. And about
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:59609:232"/>an Inch of it's ſtanding above the <hi>Mercury,</hi> the Orifice was ſeal'd up; ſo that an Inch of Air was contain'd in the Tube, which, by lifting up the Tube, was gradually expanded to ſeveral Inches: It being noted, in the mean time, how much the <hi>Mercury</hi> in the ſmall Tube, was, by the Expanded Air, in ſeveral Stations, permitted to riſe above the Surface of the <hi>Mercury</hi> in the other Tube: By which Method, the former Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being made, we inverted the Large Tube, and found by trying the <hi>Torrecellian Experiment,</hi> That that Day the Air ſuſtain'd the <hi>Mercury</hi> at 29 ¾ Inches; where it was obſerv'd, That in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the foregoing Obſervations, the Difference betwixt the Account which anſwers our <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> and the other, probably proceeded from a new Acceſs of Air, to that included Inch; and indeed, by immerging the Tube, when the Obſervations were made, we found, that it had gain'd about half an Eighth; which we judg'd might ariſe from ſome Bubbles lodg'd in the Pores of the <hi>Mercury.</hi> From which <hi>Experiment</hi> it appear'd, that the Inch of Air expanded to double it's Dimenſions, was able with a Cylinder of <hi>Mercury</hi> abuot 15 Inches, to counterpoiſe the Preſſure of the <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> which would raiſe the <hi>Mercury</hi> eight and twenty Inches, when the Spring of that Air was loſt, by a further Expanſion: So that the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> here below, muſt conſequently be as much compreſs'd, as if twenty eight Inches of <hi>Mercury</hi> gravitated upon it.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> An <hi>Explication</hi> of <hi>Rarefaction.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>IT being objected by the Author of a Book, <hi>De Corporum Inſeparabilitate,</hi> that the Spring of the Air cannot be made out, whether we allow a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> or a <hi>Plenum.</hi> Waving the Forms which he lays his Objections down in, and a particular Anſwer to his Ways of Arguing, I ſhall take the following Method, to explain the Air's Spring. For ſuppoſing the Particles of the Air to conſiſt of Matter, extended into thin <hi>Laminae,</hi> and thoſe wound and folded up, like the Spring of a Watch; and that theſe Parts of Matter ſo wound up, are in a Continual Circular Motion, it will follow, that the <hi>Laminae</hi> in this Motion will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to extend themſelves, and to recede from the <hi>Axis</hi> or Center of their Motion, till hinder'd by the Oppoſition of each other, or ſome adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Bodies: and this Expanſive Endeavour will be proportionably increas'd, as the Circular Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe Particles is quicken'd. And theſe Springy Corpuſcles thus ſhap'd, and thus Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanically mov'd, are ſufficient to account for all that we aſcribe to the Spring of the Air. For ſuppoſing the Diameter of thoſe Parts of Matter next the Surface of the Earth, compreſs'd by the whole Weight of the Incumbent <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> to be 1/1000000000000 of an Inch,<note place="margin">See <hi>Plate</hi> the Second.</note> and to be repreſented by the Third <hi>Figure</hi> A B C D; it will Naturally follow, that Part of the Incumbent Weight of the <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> being taken off, they will expand
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:59609:233"/>themſelves ſo as to be 10/1000000000000 of an Inch in Diameter, as repreſented by E F G H. ſo that theſe Zones whirling round, will take up a ſpace 1000 times bigger than before. And as from hence the Rarefaction of the Air is naturally accounted for; ſo the ſwelling of a Carp's Bladder, upon taking off the Preſſure of the <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> is explain'd by the ſame Reaſon. And as the ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous Rarefaction of the Air is hence naturally explain'd, ſo it's Forced Rarefaction by Heat, is; for if the Particles of Heat penetrating the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſtices of theſe Aery Particles be in a violent rapid Motion, by increaſing the Motion of the former Particles, they increaſe the Motion of the latter, and conſequently ſtrengthen their expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Virtue; And if theſe Rarifi'd Parts of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by expanding themſelves, leave larger In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſtices betwixt their <hi>Laminae,</hi> they muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be more pervious to the Rays of Light. So that granting this innate Motion in the Parts of Matter, and ſuch a Configuration as I have mention'd, it naturally follows, that all the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> belonging to Rarefaction and Conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, may eaſily be explain'd by it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rarefaction</hi> according to the Doctrin of the <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts.</hi>
                        </note>Nor will it be impoſſible to explain the Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and Condenſation, admitting of a <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> if we ſuppoſe with <hi>Carteſius,</hi> That the Air conſiſts of Parts which are long, ſlender and flexible; for ſuppoſing with him, that theſe are whirl'd round by the Rapid Motion of the <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buli Coeleſtes,</hi> thoſe that lie next the Surface of the Earth, muſt needs be compreſs'd and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd from that expanſive Motion, more than thoſe that have leſs Weight upon them; and conſequently, when that Compreſſion is taken
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:59609:234"/>off, the expanſive Force being encreas'd by it, they will conſequently be expanded more Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; and by whirling round, acquire longer <hi>Vortices:</hi> And for the like Reaſon the Air con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Carp's Bladder, will extend it ſelf when the Preſſure of the External <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> is taken off; and conſequently, when the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Preſſure is again admitted, thoſe ſpringy Parts being again compreſs'd are leſs able to maintain their new <hi>Vortices,</hi> but being wound up together again become more condens'd, that Preſſure reſiſting the Force of their Spring. And as for the Reaſon why Water flows into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver again in the <hi>Magdeburg</hi> Experiment, ſo impetuouſly; it hence evidently appears to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, from the Weakneſs of the Spring of the included Air, not being able to reſiſt the more violent Preſſure of the External; and for the ſame Reaſon likewiſe, the Carp's Bladder upon a reingreſs of that Air, is preſently compreſs'd into its former Inconſpicuouſneſs.</p>

                        <note place="margin">See Plate the ſecond Fig. 5.</note> I ſhall paſs on to lay down what Explanation Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> himſelf gives of it; for Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> conceiving no ſuch Difficulties in it, as our Author would repreſent, ſays, that it is ſo far from containing any Obſcurities in it, that it is plain and eaſie. For if the Wheel A B C D. be mov'd in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Motion from A I C. to K L M. each of the Points A E I G C. will either on a Plain, or in the <hi>Medium</hi> it paſſes through, form ſo many parallel Lines to I L. But if inſtead of that direct Progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Motion, it have a Circulation, each Point in one Revolution, whilſt mov'd from G to L. will form a Cyclorid. Beſides, each Point of the Circle acquires various Degrees of Celerity in its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion by this complex Motion, according to its various Poſition to a Point, which is always to be found in ſome part of the Line, drawn from the Center of the circular Motion Perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to the Progreſſive; for as the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the <hi>Radius,</hi> ſo is the Line of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:59609:235"/>Motion to the diſtance of the Point from the Center; becauſe the Line of Progreſſion is equal to the Circle, deſcrib'd on that diſtance as <hi>Radius;</hi> and therefore, each Point of the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Circle, when it touches the Perpendicular, will in reſpect of its Progreſſive Motion ſtand ſtill: This Point therefore, will be the Center of the complex Motion.</p>

                     <p>And further, the Point E having the ſame Progreſſive Motion with I, and being mov'd backwards with half the Velocity, loſes half the Progreſſive Motion forwards. And the Point A being by its Progreſſion mov'd forwards, with an equal Velocity with I, and by its Rotation (the Circle A B C D being equal to the Line I L) being carri'd back with equal Celerity, muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſtand ſtill as to the Progreſſive Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Now from hence it appearing, that the Point A, (being at Reſt, by reaſon of its two oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Motions) only touch a Point of the Line A K, without being in the leaſt mov'd upon it,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:59609:235"/>and that the Point E, (moving forwards as faſt again as it is carri'd backwards by its Rotation, and conſequently mov'd half as faſt as the Point I) not only touches the Line E K, but is mov'd upon it with a progreſſive Motion, half as quick as that of I, it will conſequently follow, that each Point in E muſt make a ſmall Line, which is a Part of the whole E C; ſo that the Contact of the former, and the Contact and the Progreſſion of the latter, being perform'd by an infinite Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Points, in an infinite Succeſſion of Inſtants, the Difficulties repreſented by our Author's Explaining it, are taken off, all that he ſays coming to no more, than that <hi>in ſuch a determinate Moment or minutes Space of time, ſuch a determirate minutes Corpuſcle, will ſucceſſively paſs over ſuch a determinate Space or Length.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP XXIV.</hi> The VVeight and Spring of the <hi>Air</hi> aſſerted.</head>
                     <p>THE Author having prov'd the Weight of the Air, by weighing it in an exhauſted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver in a Lamb's Bladder, and a Glaſs Bubble, and likewiſe in an <hi>AEolipile:</hi> And the Air's gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity being further confirm'd, by weighing the Receiver before and after it had been exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in the <hi>Magdeburg</hi> Experiments: All that Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> objects, relating to the Bladder weigh'd in the Receiver, only intimates, that the Air being blown into the Bladder, the Weight proceeds from Atoms which ſwim in that Air, or the <hi>Haltius</hi> which paſs into the Cavity of the Bladder along with the Air: But ſince this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:59609:236"/>not the Weight of the Air, but rather que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions the Cauſe; we think it ſufficient to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for what we aim'd at, to prove, that Air does gravitate, tho' the Cauſe of Gravitations be not known.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Spring of the <hi>Air</hi> proved.</note>As to the Spring of the Air, waving what trivial Objections Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> makes, I ſhall add the following Experiments to evince it.</p>
                     <p>The firſt, is, That if a Cylinder of <hi>Mercury</hi> be ſuſpended at the uſual Height, in the <hi>Torre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellian</hi> Experiment, by ſtopping the upper Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Tube, and lifting the lower End above the <hi>Baſis</hi> it reſted on before; we may obſerve, that the Finger can diſcern no Gravitation of the <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Tube; but if it be inverted, and the External Air let in, the <hi>Mercury</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did not gravitate upon the Finger, will be ſo depreſs'd by the Spring of that Air, as to cauſe it to weigh conſiderably upon it; and if the lower Orifice be unſtopp'd in the reſtagnant <hi>Mercury,</hi> the included Air will depreſs that in the Tube, below its former Stations: And if the Experiment be made in a Tube not ſo long, and both Ends be ſtopp'd with ones Finger, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the removing of the uppermoſt, the lower will perceive the Weight of the Incumbent Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of the <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> which before depreſs'd the Pulp of the Finger into the Cylindrical Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Tube; ſo that this Experiment proves both the Spring and Gravity of the Air.</p>
                     <p>The other Experiment is the Fourth in the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle,</hi> where it was evident, that a Bladder ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in the Receiver, ſubſided or ſwell'd as the Air was let in, or drawn out: And tho' Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> teaches, that the ſwelling of the
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:59609:237"/>Bladder is effected by the Air, <hi>per vim incuſſus,</hi> which getting into the Bladder, preſſes againſt the Internal Superficies of it in their circular Motions; yet, ſince from ſeveral Experiments it appears, that Bladders are impervious to Air, to deny that the Ingreſs of it, is a ſufficient An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to his Explanation: But further, were the Bladder ſo pervious to Air, it might as readily get out of the Bladder, as in, without breaking it.</p>
                     <p>And whereas Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> endeavours to expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate all the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> afforded by our Engin and Wind-Guns, by the Motion of the Aery Parts, which Motion they acquire by the Force of the Engin; yet, that the Air hath parallel Effects where it acquires no ſuch Motion, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the Experiments formerly mention'd made in the open Air, at the Top and Bottom of Hills; the <hi>Mercury</hi> being not near ſuſpended ſo high at the Top, as at the Bottom of thoſe Hills. And tho' he endeavours to Explain the difference, by ſuppoſing the Motion of the Air brisker at the Bottom than the Top of the Hill; yet, ſince it can only keep the <hi>Mercury</hi> from ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, by virtue of its Preſſure, that Preſſure muſt either proceed from its Spring or Weight; and ſince it is highly improbable, that the Preſſure of ſo few Parts of the Air, as are contiguous to the <hi>Mercury,</hi> ſhould be able to keep it from ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding, it muſt do it by virtue of the whole <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere</hi> which is equiponderant to it.</p>
                     <p>But to evince the Spring and Preſſure of the Air further, I ſhall add, that a <hi>Thermoſcope</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carri'd to the Top of a Hill, the Air con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in it not finding ſo ſtrong a Preſſure from
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:59609:237"/>the Water, which there receives a leſs Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> viſibly expands it ſelf by virtue of its Spring.</p>

                     <p>BEfore Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> ſets about an Explication of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> exhibited by our Engin, he lays down an <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> which he endeavours to explain them by; ſuppoſing that a great many earthy Particles are interſpers'd in the Air, which have a congenite circular Motion of their own; and that there is a greater Quantity of them nearer, than further from the Earth: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that it may be queſtion'd, how ſuch Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles can move in ſo exact an Order, without knocking againſt, and diſturbing each others Motion: It is as unintelligible how Matter ſhould have its Motion congenite: But to leave Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> to diſpute theſe things with other Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, I ſhall proceed to his Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver void of <hi>Air.</hi>
                        </note>And firſt, to prove that there is no <hi>Vacuum</hi> in our Receiver, he ſays, that the Air being remov'd by the Preſſure of the Sucker outward, it gets into the Receiver again betwixt the Convex and Concave Surfaces of the Sucker and the Cylinder, which if. true, it would follow, that there was a <hi>Vacuum</hi> for ſome time, <hi>viz.</hi> till the Air had time to get into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:59609:238"/>again. But that the Air is in a great Meaſure drawn out, and that the Receiver is, in reſpect of Air, empty, not only appears by thoſe Bubbles of Water which paſs through the Water, when the Receiver is encompaſs'd with it; but it further appears, by weighing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver when exhauſted, which is conſiderably lighter than before. As alſo, by obſerving, that if the Receiver be ill ſhap'd, ſo as not to be able to reſiſt the Preſſure of the outward Air, it breaks inward upon the Action of the Pump. But a further Argument is, that the Receiver being exhauſted, and the Cocks turn'd when the Receiver is encompaſs'd with Water, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Gallons will be impell'd into it, which could not be without a Penetration of Dimenſions, except the Receiver was empty. And even in the Common Experiment its evident, that the Air, upon turning of the Stop-Cock, ruſhes in with a conſiderable Noiſe.</p>
                     <p>But if Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> ſhould ſay, that the Purer Air only flows into the Receiver; I ſhall demand, how it is poſſible for that to flow in, when the Receiver is exhauſted in Water; where we might expect, that it ſhould as well raiſe Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in its Paſſage through it, as that ſuch Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles riſe in the Water in the exhauſted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver.</p>
                     <p>And tho' Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> affirms, That this Air getting into the Receiver moves up and down violently I know not how; to prove that it does not I ſhall intimate, That were it ſo, the Smoak as well as the Bladder contain'd in the Receiver in the forementioned Experiments, would be diſturb'd by that Motion; ſince upon
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:59609:238"/>the Admiſſion of the Air into the Receiver, it appears, That it puts them both into a very violent Agitation.</p>
                     <p>And, That in the <hi>Torrecellian</hi> Experiment, the Tube above the <hi>Mercury</hi> is void of Air, may be evinc'd, by reciprocally inverting the Tube; for by that Means, the <hi>Mercury</hi> will move back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with a much greater degree of Swiftneſs and Force, than if Air be let into that Part of the Cylinder which is not filled with <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And indeed, were it not allowed, That the Air is drawn out of the Receiver, for any thing that Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> hath offer'd, the Reaſon of the Aſcent or Deſcent of the <hi>Mercury,</hi> as the external Air is let in or drawn out, would be difficulty underſtood, if not altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explain'd, without admitting the Weight and Spring of the Air.</p>
                     <p>The next <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> offers to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain is, why the Sucker riſes up when the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver is exhauſted, tho' a hundred Pound Weight be ſuſpended at it; the Reaſon of which he attributes to the ſwift and violent Reper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of the Air, which was thruſt out, which finding not room enough in the World, muſt conſeuqently preſs the Sucker before it into the Space which contain'd it before; but if the Air be ſo ſwiftly repelled, I cannot underſtand, why it ſhould not reſiſt the Egreſs of Air, or raiſe the Sucker when a greater Weight is hung at it. But further, that the return of this Air does not depend on the ſwift Repercuſſion of the external Air is hence manifeſt; ſince if the Sucker be held down till the Air about it ſeems
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:59609:239"/>to be ſettled, and as calm as before; it will nevertheleſs riſe when the ſuperfluous Weight is taken away. And as for an Internal <hi>Conatus</hi> of the Included Air, were ſuch allow'd, as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> contends for, it would rather hinder than promote the Riſing of the Sucker; for were that Included Air forc'd out ſo violently, as he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and were it ſtrong enough to cauſe a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Repercuſſion in the Air, the Internal Force counterpoizing the External, the Riſing of the Sucker would not thereby in the leaſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted: But ſince from our <hi>Experiments</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, That the Receiver is, for the greateſt Part, void of Air, and that ſuch an <hi>Impetus</hi> would be of no Force, in cauſing the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to explain by it, it is more Natural to belive, that the External Preſſure of the <hi>Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere</hi> rais'd it.</p>

                     <p>WHEREAS we have in the XXXXV<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                        <hi>Experimenti,</hi> mention'd an <hi>Experiment,</hi> wherein the Water Roſe up into a long ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Tube, which was plac'd in a Perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Line; the Water in the Tube, being above the Surface of the Water, without the Tube; Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> endeavours to explain this, by the Impulſe of the Particles of Matter, ſwiftly agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated in the Air; but ſince the ſame Agitation
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:59609:239"/>of Parts within the Tube, might alſo depreſs that to an equal Surface, with the External, the Account he gives of it, is the leſs ſatisfactory.</p>
                     <p>The Reaſon which he aſſigns for the Difficulty in drawing up the Stopple, when the Receiver is exhauſted, is, a Violent <hi>Conatus,</hi> proceeding from the Motion of the Particles within; but were the <hi>Impetus</hi> ſo great, as to cauſe ſo great a Repercuſſion, as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> before ſuppos'd able to repel the Sucker, it ſhould rather raiſe the Stopple; and if that Motion contributed to the faſtning of it, it would continue upon a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admiſſion of the Air; ſince the Air in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity runs about, and is in Motion for a good while: Nor could the Plentitude he ſuppoſes, cauſe the <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> becauſe he ſuppoſes the World to be equally, and at all times full. But that the cloſe Connexion of the Stopple to the Socket, depended on the Preſſure of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Air, appear'd by cloſing the Hole in the Cover with Cement, inſtead of that Stopple; for when the Air was drawn out of the Receiver, the External Air was drawn out of the Receiver, the External Air would preſs ſo violently upon it, as to make the upper Superficies Concave, and ſometimes to force it down into the Receiver with a Noiſe, and great Violence.</p>
                     <p>He further aſſigns the Boiling of Water in our Receiver, to the Motion of the Air included; but ſince I have made it appear, That there is no ſuch Motion, our Explanation is the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable; ſince the Parts of the Liquor being agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by Heat, will be apt to to expand more powerfully upon a Removal of that Preſſure.</p>
                     <p>And tho' he ſays the Parts of the Water could not be mov'd, except <hi>à Movente contiguo, A Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:59609:240"/>Body in Motion;</hi> yet ſince he allows, that the Motion of his Earthy Parts, which ſwim in the Air is innate, and conſequently depends not on any Contiguous Body, I ſhall leave that to anſwer what he here delivers; and ſhall only intimate, That the Parts of the Water being agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, when put into the Receiver, is enough to account for the <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> when the Preſſure of the Air is taken off.</p>

                        </note>THE Firſt Particular examin'd in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is a Miſtake of Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Author's Opinion of <hi>Fluidity;</hi> the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector making the Author's Notion of <hi>Fluidity</hi> to conſiſt in the Size of the Parts of Liquid Bodies; whereas our Author aſſigns Motion, as the Chief and Principal Qualification; ſince a <hi>Coagulum</hi> of pure Spirits of Urine and Wine, may by bare Digeſtion, be turn'd into a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent Liquor; and Quick-ſilver, tho' fluid, may be turn'd into a Permanent Powder, by ſtopping the Motion of it's Parts. And tho' Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> further aſſerts, That Fluid Bodies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of Parts Diviſible into Fluids, as Quantity into Quantity; yet, ſince I have made it appear, That Fluidity depends on the Shape, Size, Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Motion; and Firmneſs, on a Reſt amongſt the Parts of Solids; and likewiſe, that Fluids are not diviſible into Fluid Parts, as Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity into Quantity, it is needleſs to repeat what is there deliver'd.</p>
                     <p>As for the Explication of Fluidity and Firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> Subſtitutes, it teaches, That the Parts of Fluids may move whilſt the whole is in Motion, and that Solids may have their Parts in Motion, tho' the whole lyes ſtill: As alſo he ſays, That the Parts of a Fluid may be render'd leſs fluid, by being compreſs'd; but ſince he hath
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:59609:242"/>aſſerted theſe things, and not prov'd them; and ſince the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> he goes upon, is ſufficiently invalidated before, the Author thinks theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire no Particular Anſwer: And tho' he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther makes an Objection againſt the Size of the Parts of Matter contributing to Fluidity and Firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; yet ſince our Author makes Motion or Reſt the Chief and Principal Requiſites, what hath been deliver'd in the Hiſtory of Fluidity and Firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, may ſuffice for an Anſwer: For that there is Motion in the Parts of Fluids, appears, if a Lump of Salt be put into Water, the Parts of which will be preſently diſſolv'd, and carry'd up to the Top of the Liquor, which could not be without Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that Reſt contributes to Solidity, is evident, ſince Water froze, becomes Ice; and on the contrary, that, as well as Metals, by having their Parts put into a violent Motion by Heat, become Fluid.</p>

                        <note place="margin">See <hi>Plate</hi> the Third and Fourth.</note>THE Structure of our <hi>Engin</hi> being ſuch, as not to admit of an Alphabetical Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo as to make it intelligible, to thoſe that are unacquainted with Mechanical Structures; and it being eaſily enough underſtood by thoſe, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that are acquainted by our Firſt <hi>Engin,</hi> we
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:59609:243"/>thought it ſufficient in our <hi>Plate,</hi> to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the <hi>Engin</hi> juſt ready to be ſet on Work; and in the Fourth the Parts, which it is made up of. Only there are two things, which may deſerve to be explain'd: Firſt the Sucker being always co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with Water; and the Perforation (p q), which goes through it in a Perpendicular Line, and together with the Stick (r s), ſupplies the Place of a Valve, being to be ſtopp'd at the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Cylinder (n o), when fill'd with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it was neceſſary the Stick (rp) ſhould be of a conſiderable Length. Secondly, The Pipe (A B) lies in a Gutter, made purpoſely in the Board (c d e f), which Board is laid over with Cement, and a piece of Iron laid upon that, to keep it from warping: In which Iron-plate is fix'd a Lip, which riſes up about the End of the Pipe (B), which is bent up, to prevent the Water which comes from the Receiver from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spilt; and notwithſtanding the Stop-cock (G H I K), might be inſerted into the Cylinder (L M N O), at (I) with Soder; yet it is much more convenient to have the Branch (I) made like a Screw; ſo that being ſcrewed into the Barrel, it may more eaſily be mended, when any thing is amiſs; Whether it be that the Air gets in betwixt the Plate and the Wood, or the Cement be drawn into the Pipe, where the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted End is united to the Receiver; and leſt the inward Orifice of the Pipe ſhould be ſtopp'd with any thing, contain'd in the Receiver drawn to it, there is fix'd at ſome Diſtance from it a Tin Plate, ſo contriv'd as to give free Paſſage to the Air.</p>
                     <pb n="437" facs="tcp:59609:243"/>
                     <p>The Wooden Part repreſented in the Plate, and which contains the Cylinder, is always ſo full of Water as able to overtop the Cylinder, and to make the Sucker ſoft and plump, by which means it is more exactly fitted to the Cylindrical Cavity.</p>
                     <p>And as for the Iron Plate abovemention'd, it hath this Conveniency, that it excludes the Air, better than if the Receiver had a Stop-cock, in moſt <hi>Experiments,</hi> tho' in ſome it is leſs ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virceable.</p>
                     <p>But moſt of the following <hi>Experiments</hi> may be try'd in our Firſt <hi>Engin,</hi> if the following Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations be made. And Firſt, If a ſquare Board, and a ſuitable Iron Plate, ſuch as is made uſe of in this <hi>Engin,</hi> be faſten'd oppoſite to the Iron Rack, to the Upper Part of the great Cylinder, and a Glaſs Tube, like that juſt now deſcrib'd, be fix'd to the Lower Branch of the Stop-cock, with a Cement, made with near an equal Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Wax and Turpentine, in Winter, and three Parts of Wax to two of Turpentine in Summer; for the Ingreſs of Air being thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, upon drawing down the Sucker, the Air, by Virtue of it's own Spring, will force it ſelf out of the Receiver.</p>

                        <p>IN order to make an Eſtimate of the Force of the Air's Spring, in it's ſeveral Degrees of Expanſion; We fill'd the fourth part of a Viol with Quickſilver, the Neck of which was none of the largeſt, in which we fix'd a Glaſs Tube with hard Wax, the lower End reaching almoſt to the Bottom of the Quickſilver, and the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per almoſt a Yard above the Viol, which being conveigh'd into a Receiver (<hi>See Plate</hi> 5. <hi>Fif.</hi> 1.) which was pretty Tall,<note place="margin">See Plate <hi>5.</hi> Fig. <hi>1.</hi>
                           </note> upon an Exſuction of the Air in the Receiver, that in the Viol ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panding
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:59609:244"/>it ſelf, rais'd the <hi>Mercury</hi> 27 Inches in the Tube; yet when the Air was again admitted into the Receiver, it ſubſided ſo far as to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt; if not quite equal with the Surface of the <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Viol: And this Experiment was try'd before the Famous Savilian Geometer Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> tho' it does not conſtantly ſucceed alike, it ſometimes riſing higher than at others.</p>
                        <p>In which Experiment the following Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were to be made. <hi>First,</hi> That ſo much Air being blown into the Viol, to try whether it was ſtanch, as was able to raiſe the <hi>Mercury</hi> three Inches in the Pipe, upon the Exſuction of the External Air in the Receiver, the <hi>Mercury</hi> roſe 30 Inches above that in the Viol.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> When the <hi>Mercury</hi> is taken out of the Receiver, it does not ſuddenly ſubſide as low as before it's Aſcent, the Air being a little more Expanded by the Heat of the Cement when melted with an Iron.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whilſt the Air included in the Viol retains any conſiderable Springineſs, after each Exſuction the <hi>Mercury</hi> will be rais'd by the Force of its Expanſion, a conſiderable Height above what that Air is able to ſuſpend it at, and makes ſeveral Vibrations before it ſettles.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Upon the firſt Exſuction the <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> riſes near ⅔ of the whole Weight that the Expanſion of the included Air is able to raiſe it, and continues every ſubſequent Exſuction to riſe leſs and leſs as the weight of the ſuſpended <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> encreaſes, and the Spring of the Internal Air grows weaker, and as the <hi>Mercury</hi> riſes leſs every Exſuction than it did before, ſo are the Vibrations leſs conſiderable.</p>

                           <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Having obſerv'd the Weight of the Air in a good Barometer, when it was but light, the <hi>Mercury</hi> was rais'd to 29 and ⅜ tho' ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Tryal it was but 29 Inches high.</p>
                        <p>To make an Eſtimate of the Quantity of Air which rais'd the <hi>Mercury</hi> to the uſual height, we counterpois'd the Viol, and then filling it full of Water, we found it to weigh about 5 Ounces 2 Drachms, and about 20 Grains; but ſo much being pour'd off, that the remaining Water on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly filled the Space which the <hi>Mercury</hi> was before contain'd in, it weigh'd 1 Ounce 2 Drachms 14 Grains, ſo that the Air which by it's Expanſion elevated the <hi>Mercury,</hi> fill'd the Space of no more than 4 Ounces and a few Grains: The Diameter of the Pipe employ'd in this Experiment was no more than the ⅛ of an Inch.</p>

<pb n="444" facs="tcp:59609:247"/>be reiterated by firſt letting in the Air again, and then exhauſting the Receiver by pumping it out afreſh.</p>
                        <p>From the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> exhibited by this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it appears, that the Spring of the Air was able to raiſe the Water in the Tube to a much greater Height than the Pipe we made uſe of. Secondly, From hence it appears, that Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contain'd betwixt two Parcels of Air, may be put into Motion by its Spring, without the Concurrence of adventitious Heat. Thirdly, we obſerv'd, That when the Air was in a great Meaſure exhauſted, the upper Receiver being taken off, the external Air preſs'd the Water quite down to the Bottom of the Tube, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Bubbles getting through the Water, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves with the Air in the Bottle: But what was more ſtrange was, that when the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver had been taken off a conſiderable time, ſeveral Bubbles of Air continu'd to make their way through the Water, as if the Spring of the Included Air, being before expanded, could not be brought again to its former State of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; but like a Balance put in Motion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd ſeveral ſucceſſive Vibrations, reſiſting each Impreſs of the <hi>Atmoſphere.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But the Chief Remark in this Experiment was, that the Salient Water in the Receiver, form'd ſeveral large Lines, ſome of which were Parabolical, when the Receiver was pretty well exhauſted.</p>

                        <p>But the chief Aim of our <hi>Experiment,</hi> being only to try to what Height the Water could be rais'd, I caus'd the Pump to be nimbly ply'd, till the Water could riſe no higher; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, and the Height of the Water meaſur'd by a String, we found it to be 33 Foot, and about ſix Inches; <hi>Quick-ſilver</hi> in a <hi>Baroſcope,</hi> at the ſame time, ſtanding at 29 Inches, and about 3 eights of an Inch; ſo that the Water was near fourteen times as high as the <hi>Mercury.</hi>

                        <p>In which <hi>Experiment,</hi> that the upper part of the Tube was ſufficiently exhauſted, appear'd from ſeveral Circumſtances; as Firſt, If any Air got in at Crannies in the Pipe, it would riſe in Bubbles, eaſily to be diſtinguiſh'd, from thoſe which roſe from the Pores of the Water; and tho' the Quantity of thoſe Bubbles was conſiderable, yet more Air being thrown out by the Pump, than could get in, it muſt needs be empty enough. But,</p>
                        <p>In this <hi>Experiment,</hi> it was to be noted, That when firſt the Water appear'd in the Glaſs Tube, they would be very numerous, and form a Froth; yet, when the Pumping was further continu'd, they grew leſs and leſs: Secondly, we obſerv'd, that the Water made ſeveral Vibrations in it's Riſe; which, tho' near a Foot at the firſt, grew leſs and leſs.

<pb n="460" facs="tcp:59609:255"/>exhauſted Receiver at once, for by obſerving, when the Air is expanded to each Mark in the little one, how far it is expanded in the large one; we may learn, how much the Receiver is exhauſted, for the future, by taking notice of the Expanſion of the Air in the Leg of that lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Gage. And,</p>
                        <p>This Gage is much more uſeful than ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Firſt, becauſe the <hi>Mercury</hi> being a heavy Body, the Air, by expanding it ſelf, is leſs apt to make it run over, or to make it's way in the Form of Bubbles through the Mercurial Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder, as it would if other Fluids were made uſe of inſtead of it. Secondly, The longer Leg of the Gage is to be mark'd, by ſticking Wax or Knobs of Glaſs to the Pipe, every Tenth being of a different Colour from the reſt, at equal Diſtances from each other, which Diviſions will be leſs ſubject to be rubb'd off than Papers, which are alſo ſubject, in ſome Experiments, to be wet. Thirdly, The Leg of the <hi>Syphon</hi> in which the Air is included, may be either ſeal'd up, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is divided by the aforemention'd Marks, or after, by drawing out the End of the Tube into a ſmall <hi>Apex;</hi> and when about an Inch of the Pipe is fill'd with Air, it may be ſeal'd up by blowing a Lamp Horizontally upon the <hi>Apex.</hi> Fourthly, Where very Nice Obſervations are to be made, and the Receiver admits of a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Gage, inſtead of <hi>Mercury</hi> we may make uſe of a Tincture of Roſes, or of Spirit of Wine with <hi>Cocheneel;</hi> in which, the Exſuction of the Air will be more nicely repreſented. Fifthly, We may vary the Mercurial Gage, by ordering the ſhorter Leg, ſo that it may have a Bubble
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:59609:255"/>about half an Inch Diameter, at an Inch diſtance from the <hi>Baſis</hi> of that Leg, which Bubble muſt have a Pipe upon the upper Part of it to give way to the Air; which Bubble hath this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage above the other, that leſs Air may be contain'd in the Top of the longer Leg; ſince the <hi>Mercury</hi> not being capable of being rais'd ſo high, the Rarefaction of the included Air will be render'd more apt to be eſtimated by the Eye. Sixthly, This Gage is much more uſeful than thoſe mention'd by other Authors, becauſe it gives us an Account of the ſeveral Degrees of the Air's Rarefaction.</p>

                        <p>IN order to try, whether there be any finer Subſtance than Air, in the exhauſted Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, we contriv'd to make a Pair of Bellows of a Bladder, whoſe Baſes were Paſte-board,<note place="margin">See <hi>Fig.</hi> the 7th. <hi>Plate</hi> the 8th.</note> the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per being cover'd with a Plate of Pewter, to which was fix'd a Leaden weight to preſs it down: Beſides, over againſt the Noſe of the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, in which the Neck of the Bladder ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, it was contriv'd, that the End of a Feather was fix'd ſo, that if any Subtle Matter were forc'd out of the Bellows, it ſhould diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it ſelf by moving that Feather.</p>
                        <p>The Bellows being thus provided, and the Pillars, to which the Feather is faſtened, being joyn'd to the upper Baſis of the Bellows, with Cement, we fix'd a Weight to the Lower Baſis, and convey'd it into the Receiver;<note place="margin">See <hi>Fig.</hi> the Eighth.</note> where we obſerv'd, upon the exhauſting of the Receiver, that the Air in the Bellows rais'd up the upper Baſis, together with it's Weight; and the Air riſing out at the Vent, manifeſtly mov'd the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: But when the Receiver was quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, and the Weight upon the Upper Baſis depreſs'd it violently, we could not perceive that the Feather was in the leaſt mov'd, and the like was obſerv'd upon repeating the <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>

                        <p>WE took a ſlender Pipe, and having ty'd a Linen-cloth to the Iower Orifice, we fill'd it with <hi>Minium;</hi> and immerging it in Water in a Wide-mouth'd Glaſs about an Inch, the Water aſcended about 30 Inches; and the <hi>Experiment</hi> being again repeated in another, it roſe 40 Inches.</p>
                        <p>In which kind of <hi>Experiments,</hi> the following Particulars were to be obſerv'd: Firſt, That other Powders being made uſe of inſtead of this, the <hi>Experiment</hi> did not ſucceed ſo well; nor was the Succeſs much better, when we made uſe of Ink inſtead of Water.</p>

                        <p>Thirdly, We obſerv'd, That the Water aſcends not to it's utmoſt, under 30 Hours, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times longer.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, From hence it appears, That the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in our Tube roſe, without any ſwelling of the ſides of the Tube, which ſome Learn'd Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Cauſe of Water's Riſing in Filtres to.</p>

                        <p>As for the Cauſe of ſo ſtrange a <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> tho' I will not be poſitive in it; yet, it may not improbably depend on the like Cauſe, as the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of Water in the Tube, mention'd in the foregoing Experiment.</p>
                        <p>For we may obſerve, that the Edges of Water are not only above the Superficies of the reſt of the Water; but <hi>Sea-Salt</hi> as well as ſeveral others, chryſtallize at the Top of the Liquor they ſwim in, and near the ſides of the Glaſs, their Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation being promoted by the Coldneſs of it; which Salts, when once the ſides of the Glaſs is beſet with them, the Water may riſe to the Top, for the ſame Reaſon that it does in the ſlender Pipe before mention'd, and Salts carri'd up to the Top of thoſe, and coagulating there, ſtill lay a further Bottom for their Aſcent; and ſo ſucceſſively, till they riſe to the Top of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol: And that there are Paſſages betwixt theſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Parts, for the Water to aſcend through, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears; ſince they may be broke off in Flakes,

<pb facs="tcp:59609:280"/>and Condenſation of the Air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hopeing it would help ſome to a ſeaſonable Reflection on what was before delivered; I have added what he hath taught concerning the admirable Rarefaction of the Air, and the Duration of its Spring; as alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning its Condenſation and admirable different Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, when rarified and compreſſed: And ſince theſe Subjects renew our Conſiderations concerning the Spring of the Air, I have added further, a Chapter of the <hi>Weakened Spring</hi> of the <hi>Air,</hi> out of the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſactions.</hi> And becauſe the Spring and weight of the Air and their Effects, are not the only Qualities and Conſiderations to be taken notice of in the Atmoſphere, from thoſe I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to deliver what he hath Taught concerning <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſcopes</hi> and their Utilities; as alſo what he hath writ of the Efficacy of the Airs Moiſture: And becauſe there are ſeveral Qualities in the Air which not only affect our outward Senſes, but have a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Influence on the Maſs of Humours which cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate in our Bodies, and on whoſe Tempers the Preſervation or Diſtempers of a human Body de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, I have added what he hath deliver'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Salubrity and Inſalubrity of the Air, whoſe variations in Temperature, alter the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
<pb facs="tcp:59609:281"/>of the Humors of our Bodies. And ſince we are not only affected by manifeſt Qualities of the Air, but alſo by occult ones, I have laid down what our Author hath ſaid on that Subject: and ſince Magnetical and Electrical Qualities are generally accounted Occult ones, I have added his Tracts on thoſe Subjects. And to conclude the Third Book, I have added his <hi>General Hiſtory of the Air,</hi> which I have therefore placed the laſt relating to that Element, becauſe it conſiſts of ſeveral Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which belong to ſeveral of the preceding Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, or bear a relation to ſome others which follow, concerning Colours, Taſts, and Odours. And having thus ended the Third Book, the Fourth contains thoſe Subjects which have a more immediate Relation to the Outward Senſes, and are conſidered as their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; which I therefore for diſtinction ſake place together: Of which what our Author hath delivered concerning the Mechanical Production of Taſts, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, and Colours, I have laid down in this Volume, and ſhall proceed to the remaining Objects of our Senſes, in the Third Volume; where I ſhall give a ſhort Account of the Method I take in that, and in the mean time ſubſcribe my ſelf the candid Readers</p>

                        <p>AS in the Experiments recited in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Volume, it appear'd, that the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the External Air, occaſions the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of drawing up the Sucker of a Syringe; ſo I ſhall now ſhew, that the Preſſure of the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Air, upon the Surface of the Water, in which the Syringe is immerſed, cauſes it to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend, when the Sucker is drawn up.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59609:289"/>it was as difficult to raiſe the Sucker, as when the End of the Syringe was ſtopped, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Air which was able to keep the Sucker from riſing, being unable to raiſe the Mercury.</p>

                        <p>But what was moſt Remarkable in this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment was, that after ſome time the Water ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing about an Inch in the Tube, above the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Water without it, we ſeveral times rais'd the Sucker 2 or 3 Inches, and fuffered it

                        <p>TO meaſure the force of the Air's Expanſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we fixed a Syringe in a Frame, that it might be kept firm and erect; which being done, we provided a Leaden Hoop, which was ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended at the Top of the Sucker, and hung ſo far below the Bottom of the Syringe, that it might have Space enough to riſe in upon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion of the Air in the Cavity of the Syringe, when the Receiver ſhould be exhauſted; the Weight in the mean time being prevented from compreſſing the Air beyond it's natural State by a String, the one end of which was tyed to the Top of the Sucker, and the other to the Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Key; which being done, and the Pump ſet on Work, we found, that the Expanding Air was able to raiſe about 7 or 8 pound Weight, and had the Rammer had a free Paſſage it probably would have raiſed a much greater Weight; but the Experiment was leſs ſatisfactory in determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the force of the Air's Expanſion, in elevating a determinate Weight; becauſe the Air made it's way too eaſily betwixt the convex Superficies of the Sucker, and the concave Surface of the Cylinder.</p>
                        <p>Therefore to be more exact, I cauſed two Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linders to be made different both in Length and Breadth, the Diameter of the one being an Inch,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59609:295"/>and of the other two Inches; In the former, I put a Lamb's Bladder, which contained a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Quantity of Air, and having ordered the Receiver to be exhauſted, I found, that a Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Air of an Inch Diameter, was able to raiſe a Weight of 10 Pound <hi>Averdupoiz</hi> Weights; but tho' the Bladder for a long time kept the Air from flying away, yet when it was loaded with the utmoſt Weight it was able to bear, ſome Air getting out of the Bladder rendred our Tryal leſs ſatisfactory.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore we made uſe of a Cylinder 4 Inches Deep and two in Diameter, which having a broad Baſis to ſtand upon, we put a Lamb's Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into it well blown and tyed;<note place="margin">

And by repeating the Tryal we found, that the Air in the Bladder, when the Receiver was exhauſted, was able to bear up 7 pound Weight more, by which Weight the Mark upon the Plug, was not depreſſed below the top of the Cylinder.</p>
                        <pb n="15" facs="tcp:59609:295"/>
                        <p>But in trying theſe Experiments the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Particulars are to be Noted.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That the Plug muſt be ſo adapted to the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder as to move up and down eaſily; alſo it muſt be of a convenient length, not exceeding an Inch and a half; and it will be likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that the Plug ſhould have a ſtrong Ledge upon the upper part of the Cylindrical Surface, that it may reſt upon the Edges of the Cylinder and ſuſtain the Weights laid upon it more firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. When the Bladder was put into the hollow Cylinder, we took care to adapt it by eaſie and frequent Compreſſions to the Cavity it was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in, making a Mark in the inſide of the Cylinder where the Air in it's Natural State was Compreſſed to, that we might learn what Weight the Expanſion of the Air was able to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain above that Mark; for the Air being preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally compreſſed, upon the Account of that accidental preſſure may be able to raiſe a greater Weight than Air uncompreſſed, ſo that the Weight it raiſes above that Mark is alone to be taken for what Air condenſed is able to lift up more than the Air in it's Natural State.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. When the Bladder was taken out of the Cylinder, the Figure of it was proportionable to the Cavity, which it was contained in, being 2 Inches Diameter, and 2 Inches and ½ long.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. From the Experiments now mentioned it appears, that the Air is able at it's firſt Expanſion, to raiſe a Weight proportionably larger accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the different Bores of the Cylinders
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59609:296"/>made uſe of; but when it hath been a little more Expanded the Proportion is not ſo exact, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a ſmall Quantity of Air being to fill up ¼ or ½ part of an Inch more, the ſmaller Quantity of Air muſt be much more rarified and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently loſe of it's expanſive Force.</p>
                        <p>But comparing the expanſive Force of Air in different Bores at it's firſt Expanſion, ſome may think the Proportion not exact; ſince the ſmall Bladder being able to raiſe no more but 10 Pound, and the Weight which the larger raiſes being 42, it is more than a Duplicate Proportion-of what our Hypotheſis requires; but if we conſider that comparing the Diameter of each Cylinder, the Bladder in the leſs, proportion ably takes up more Room than in the larger; it may be ſufficient to account for the Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Conſidering that the Bladders in which Air is Included, may ſtraiten the Cavities of the Cylinders, the expanſive Force of the Air might be more exactly determined, could Cylinders be contrived ſtanch enough without ſuch helps.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. And it will not a little contribute to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Force of the Air's Spring difficult to be determined, that the Air it ſelf at different times varies, in it's degrees of Preſſure: Yet from what hath been ſaid it ſeems probable, that were it poſſible to contrive an exact Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder very tite one, of an Inch Bore would be able to raiſe above 10 pound Weight.</p>

                        <p>TO Compare the Gravity of Air and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I weighed a Glaſs Bubble in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, which I found to weigh above half a Grain more in the exhauſted Receiver than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Air was drawn out; and this Bubble being weighed in the open Air counterpoiſed 68 Grains and an half; upon which the Bubble being immerſed in Water, we found that the Air in it had been ſo far rarified by the Heat employed in ſealing it up, that the Nip being broke off, it ſucked in 125 Grains of Water, the Glaſs together with the Water ſucked into it weighing 193 ½ Grains: The whole Cavity of the Bubble being large enough to contain 739 Grains of Water, it weighing 807 ½ Grains, ſo that the Proportion betwixt the Weight of the Air and Water did not quite amount to 1228 to 1.</p>
                        <p>Having weighed a Glaſs Bubble in the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, whoſe Weight was 60 Grains, the Air con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it <hi>in Vacuo</hi> weighed 27/92 of a Grain, and the Weight of ſuch a Quantity of Water as it would contain, weighed 720 ¼ Grains. In
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59609:301"/>which Experiment the Proportion of Air to Water in Weight was as 857 17/27 to one. But <hi>Galileo</hi> ſays, Water is but 400 times heavier than Water, tho' <hi>Ricciolus</hi> is as much miſtaken on the other ſide, who ſays it is 10000 times hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier.</p>
                        <p>To inform my ſelf further of the Weight of the Air, I took the following Meaſures; having exhauſted a Receiver, and when it was void of Air counterballanced it, upon turning the Stop-Cock and a Reingreſs of Air, it weighed 36 Grains more than before, which ſucceeded when tryed a ſecond time, and likewiſe a third. And then the Receiver being exhauſted was immerſed in Water, and the Stop-Cock turn'd to give way to an Ingreſs of Water, and when as much Water as was able to enter into the Receiver had ſucceeded in the Place of the exhauſted Air, we turned the Cock again to keep that Water in, and the Receiver being again weighed, the Water weighed 47 Ounces, 3 Drachms and 6 Grains, ſo that the Water was heavier than its bulk of Air, near 650 Grains, the Mercury in a Baroſcope at the ſame time being boyed up to 29 Inches ¾, ſo that the Weight and condenſed ſtate of the Atmoſphere being greater then than uſually, was the Reaſon why the Diſproportion was not as great as at other times; tho' we may reaſonably ſuſpect, that the Quantity of Air contained in the Pores of the Water, joyning with that in the Receiver, might hinder ſo much Water from getting in as was requiſite to fill the Space deſerted by the Exhauſted Air; beſides ſeveral Particles of Air might probably get in at the Stop-Cock, whilſt the Experiment was
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59609:302"/>trying, which joyning with the Air remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Receiver might contribute to prevent a ſufficient Ingreſs of Water.</p>
                        <p>From all which Experiments it appears, that tho' the Weight of the Atmoſphere is ſo vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that it is impoſſible to know exactly the Proportion betwixt it and Water, yet it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that Water is to Air ſome Number be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt 600 and 1100 to 1, being greater or leſs as the Atmoſphere is more or leſs conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. But theſe Tryals are only of uſe in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for the Weight of Water as well as Air, is ſo different in moſt Countries, that it is requiſite to make frequent Experiments in each, to determine the Proportion of the Weight of Air in ſuch Places.</p>

                           </note> it muſt be ſupported in a Wooden Frame, (See <hi>Fig.</hi> the ſecond;) and then a Quantity of Water being thrown into the Tube <hi>P. Q.

                        <p>The Reaſons why this double Engin is prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to a ſingle one, is becauſe it evacuates the Receiver more ſpeedily, and alſo with leſs trouble; for whereas in a ſingle one the Pillar of Air which preſſes againſt the deſcending Sucker is to be reſiſted by force, as well to depreſs the Sucker
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59609:303"/>as to keep it from riſing up again, in this double one the Weight of the Atmoſphere depreſſes one Plug proportionably as it reſiſts the Riſing of the other, and the Motion of the Plugs up and down is rendered much more eaſy, when the Receiver is in ſome meaſure exhauſted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Atmoſphere which lies upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending Sucker helps the Operator to weigh it down, the Spring of the included Air being ſo far weakned as not to reſiſt the Weight of the Atmoſpherical Pillar that lies upon it.</p>

                        <head>PLATE <hi>IV.</hi> A deſcription of the Mercurial Gage made uſe of in the following Experiment.</head>
                        <p>The Gage <hi>A. B. C. D. E.</hi> is made up of three Glaſs Tubes cemented together,<note place="margin">See Plate <hi>4</hi> Fig. <hi>1.</hi>
                           </note> ſo that their Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties make a continued Paſſage, being open to each other; The Tube <hi>B. C. D.</hi> is deſignedly crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the lower Orifice of the Tube <hi>E. D.</hi> as well as the Orifice of Tube <hi>A. B.</hi> may be ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented to it; which being done, the crooked Tube, whoſe Diameter is larger than either of the other two, is to be filled with Mercury, and then the Orifice <hi>E.</hi> of the ſmaller Tube is to be hermetically Sealed up; but the Orifice <hi>A.</hi> of the Tube <hi>A. B.</hi> whoſe Diameter is larger than that of <hi>E. D.</hi> is to be left open.</p>
                        <p>This Gage being put in a Receiver when it is exhauſted, the Air contained in the Tube <hi>E. D.</hi> will expand ſo powerfully as to deſcend into the crooked one to <hi>C.</hi> forcing the Mercury to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59609:304"/>riſe into the Tube <hi>B. A.</hi> almoſt to the Top, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the included Air hath loſt it's Spring.</p>
                        <p>To diſcover then the Quantity of Air inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in a Receiver, we may make uſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver <hi>F. G. E.</hi> which being placed on the Plate <hi>L. M.</hi> we muſt try the Torrecellian Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by inverting the Tube <hi>H.</hi> fill'd with Mercury into the Glaſs <hi>I.</hi> and then the Top of the Receiver <hi>F.</hi> being clos'd with Cement, and the Tube <hi>A. B.</hi> and <hi>E. D.</hi> being mark'd with Papers, as the Mercury in the Receiver is ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended at 30, 29, or 28 Inches or leſs, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly as the Receiver is exhauſted, the ſame Marks, <hi>viz.</hi> 30, 29, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being placed upon the Papers, paſted on the Tubes of the Mercurial Gage, at each diſtinct Surface of the expand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Air and the riſing Mercury, for the future, when the Air and Mercury deſcend and aſcend to thoſe Marks, in the exhauſted Receiver, it will denote, that the Receiver is ſo far exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the remaining Air is only able to bare up a Cylinder of Mercury in the Torrecellian Experiment, ſo many Inches as the Mark to which the lower Surface of the Air, and the upper Surface of the Mercury reſt at, is more or leſs in Numbers.</p>
                        <p>But if the Air contain'd in the Receiver, be more than naturally compreſs'd, it will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe compreſs the Air contain'd in the Tube <hi>E. D.</hi> by ſqueezing the Mercury ſomewhat into the lower part of the Tube. How much taller a Cylinder of Mercury Air ſo compreſs'd will bear up, than when it is but naturally condens'd, we may learn by the following Computation.</p>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:59609:304"/>
                        <p>For ſuppoſing a determinate Quantity of Air to be contain'd in the Space <hi>A.</hi> when the Force that compreſſes it is <hi>F.</hi> if the Preſſure <hi>F.</hi> be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by the Preſſure <hi>G.</hi> it will compreſs the Air contain'd in <hi>A.</hi> into half the ſpace it took up before;<note place="margin">See Fig. <hi>2.</hi>
                           </note> ſo that the remaining Space <hi>B.</hi> will be ½ a part of the Whole: And if to the Preſſure <hi>F. G.</hi> we add <hi>H.</hi> the Air which poſſeſſed the Space <hi>A.</hi> when it was only preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>F.</hi> will be ſqueez'd into a fourth Part of the Space <hi>A. viz. C.</hi> And conſequently the Air compreſs'd will poſſeſs a Space proportionable to the Whole, as the firſt Preſſure is to a total Preſſure.</p>
                        <p>The Remaining Space: the Total Space.</p>
                        <p>The Firſt Preſſure: the Total Preſſure.</p>
                        <p>So that three of thoſe Quantities being known, the Rule of Proportion will teach us the fourth. For if the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> as uſually condens'd in <hi>England,</hi> poſſeſſes the Tube <hi>E. D.</hi> and the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere</hi> is then able to raiſe a Mercurial Tube of 30 Inches; When that Air is compreſs'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Space <hi>N. E.</hi> to know the Quantity of it's Preſſure, I exactly meaſure the Space <hi>N. E.</hi> which if 6 Inches, I conſtitute that the firſt Term or Quantity of Preſſure; ſo that the ſecond Term will be the whole Space <hi>D. E.</hi> ſuppoſe 12 Inches; the third Term will be the Height of 30 Inches of Mercury, which was the firſt Preſſure; and ſo the fourth Term or total Preſſure will be found to be 60 Inches of Mercury; From whence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the Air ſo condens'd in the Receiver, to be able to bear up a Mercurial Cylinder 60 In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches tall.</p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:59609:305"/>
                        <p>And by the ſame Principle before laid down, it will be no difficult matter to judge, what the Proportion betwixt the ſize of the Tube <hi>A. B.</hi> and <hi>E. D.</hi> ought to be; for that depending on the Length of the Legs, the higer they are, the more able they are to reſtrain the Air, when it is but a little dilated in the ſealed Part. For ſuppoſing the Length of <hi>A. B.</hi> to be 10 Inches, which Height of the Mercury is ⅓ of the uſual Preſſure; the Tube <hi>A. B.</hi> will be large enough if it be as big again as <hi>E. D.</hi> for when the Mercury hath aſcended to <hi>A.</hi> the expanded Air in the other Leg poſſeſſing the Space which it forced the Mercury out of, will take up three times as much more as it did before; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, ⅓ of it's firſt Preſſure will be able to curb it's Spring: But if the Legs were not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſo long, then the Mercury being but partly expell'd out of the crooked Tube, the Diameter of the Tube <hi>A. B.</hi> ought to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably larger in reſpect of <hi>E. D.</hi> That the aſcending Mercury leaving it more ſpace to expand in, it's Spring may be ſo far ſpent, that the Mercury by it's Weight may ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly reſiſt it's further Expanſion: And it would always anſwer, if the Height of the Gage be in the ſame proportion to 30 Inches, as the Space firſt poſſeſſed by the Air is to the Whole, which that Air would poſſeſs in <hi>Vacuo,</hi> according to the Principle above delivered.</p>
                        <p>The Tube is more uſeful when longer, than ſhorter, becauſe the expanding Air being more able to drive the Mercury into the Tube <hi>A. B.</hi> more Degrees of it's Rarefaction will be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, tho' leſs ſenſibly. But</p>
                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:59609:305"/>
                        <p>The <hi>D. C.</hi> ought to hold Mercury enough to fill the Tube <hi>A. B.</hi> before the Air in the Tube <hi>E. D.</hi> can make it's way out; But how much larger, or of what Figure it is, is not ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial.</p>

                        <p>The Method to preſs Air into this Globe is this; I ſet my Foot upon the crooked End of the Sucker <hi>D.</hi> and then pulling up the Globe, as
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59609:308"/>ſoon as the Tube <hi>C.

                        <p>And this Wind-Gun hath theſe Advantages above any other yet mentioned; Firſt, that it is not ſo ſubject to be ſpoiled, as thoſe that have two Valves; Secondly, it is eaſily mended, what is amiſs being taken out at the Elliptick Hole. Thirdly, it is much more ſtanch, the Crannies being ſtopped with Silver Soder, which dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges not the Leather on the Valve, becauſe it is put in after the Soder is cooled, at the Elliptick Hole. Fourthly, ſeveral Bodies may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed into it at the Elliptick Hole, whereby we may be enabled to try ſeveral Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

In Confirmation of which Conjecture, I ſhut up a Mouſe in my Pneumatick Engin, and rarifi'd the Air ſo much, that it poſſeſs'd three times the Space it did before; upon which, the Mouſe ſeem'd better, but preſently began to be ſick, yet underwent no ſenſible Alteration up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an intromiſſion of Air: The like ſucceſs happen'd three times ſucceſſively, tho' at the laſt the Mouſe died.</item>

Theſe being included in a Receiver, the Air was pump'd out, and upon a Re-admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it, the Bubble collected at the Top, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 8/10 of about 100 part of an Inch. Soon after, a Tube, to be deſcrib'd by and by, was fill'd with the ſame Water, and inverted; and when the Receiver, into which it was conveigh'd, was ſo far exhauſted, that the Water in the Pipe
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:59609:404"/>ſunk even with the ſtagnant Water, Air was let in, and roſe the Water within a Tenth part and ½ of an Inch to the Top. The Tube was 43 ¼ Inches above the ſtagnant Water; this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment being twice try'd, the firſt time the Space poſſeſs'd by the Air was ¼ of an Inch, and more; the ſecond it was ½ and 1/15. The firſt time the Water ſubſided level with the ſtagnant Water: In the ſecond Tryal, within 4 or 5 In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of it.</p>
                        <p>In theſe Experiments it was obſervable, that tho' the Air poſſeſs'd ſo little Room in the Pores of the Water, that the Water ſeem'd not to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide when it was drawn out; yet, the Air in the Cavity of the Tube, poſſeſs'd a conſiderable Space.</p>

                        <p>To diſcover more nicely what Quantity of Air is contain'd in the Pores of Water, we made uſe of a Pipe, which conſiſted of a Globous Part 3 ½ Inches Diameter, and a Stem 9 Inches long; an Inch of which, at the Top, was melted and drawn out 2 or 3 Inches, till it was as ſlender as a Crow Quill: This Glaſs being fill'd with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was with a Pedeſtal conveigh'd into a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, and upon evacuating of it, Bubbles plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully roſe, and made a kind of a Froth or Foam, but breaking at the Top of the ſlender Pipe, they did not run over. When the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver had been pretty well exhauſted, we left off pumping till the Water had been pretty well
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:59609:404"/>freed from Bubbles; and ſo we ſucceſſively pump'd and left off again, till the Water ſeem'd quite free from Air; and then, letting in External Air, the Water did not ſeem a Hairs breadth lower than before. The like Experiment was try'd with Claret, which made us think it worth while to try what kind of Subſtances may be obtain'd from Aerial and Spirituous Bodies, by handling them thus.</p>

                        <p>In this Liquor there are two things worth our Notice; the Firſt is, that when the Viol hath lain quiet and ſtopp'd a competent time, the upper Part will appear void of Fumes, ſo that the Air will retain but a certain Quantity; which may help to give a Reaſon, why the ſame Air which will be clogg'd with Steams, in a ſhort time becomes unfit for Reſpiration.</p>
                        <p>The Second is, that in <hi>Vacuo</hi> for want of Air, tho' the Bottle was unſtopp'd, theſe Exhalations would not riſe; but as ſoon as it was let into the Receiver, they riſing up plentifully, were drawn out along with the Air, a ſecond time exhauſted.

                     </head>
                     <p>THe firſt Paſſage in Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s Problemata <hi>de Vacuo</hi> taken Notice of is this, <hi>Viz.</hi> He ſays,<note place="margin">Why con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous Marbles are not eaſily ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</note> if a <hi>Vacum interſperſum,</hi> were allow'd in the Air, when two Flat Marbles are exactly adapted to each other's Superficies, they might as eaſily be ſeparated, as moved, when ſeparate in the open Air. To which it is Anſwered, that tho' there be ſeveral Vacuities interſperſed betwixt the Particles of an Atmoſpherical Pillar of Air; yet notwithſtanding, ſince each of thoſe Particles are endued with a Specifick gravity, and are incumbent on the ſurface of the uppermoſt Marble, whatever ſeparates thoſe two Bodies, muſt have a force able to ſuſtain the weight of the Pillar of Air which leans on it. But when the Air is contiguous to each ſide of the Marble, having an equal Preſſure on each ſide from the Ambient Atmoſphere, there is required no more force to move it up and down, than is ſufficient to ſurmount the Weight of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And tho' Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> ſays, that the Reaſon why two Marbles cannot be Separated ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:59609:416"/>is, becauſe the Air cannot inſtantly fill the ſpace deſerted by them; yet from Experiments already laid down; it appears, that they may be pulled aſunder, and much more eaſily, in an exhauſted Receiver where there is no Air to ſucceed the ſpace left betwixt them upon their Avulſion. Where it is evident, that a force able to overcome the hardneſs of the Stone, is not requiſite to draw them aſunder, but only ſo much as is able to raiſe the Weight of the upper Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and in the open Air as much as is ſufficient to over-power the incumbent Atmoſphere.</p>
                     <p>Another Argument againſt what Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> lays down in favour of a Plenitude, may be taken from the following Experiment. We took a Glaſs Bubble about as big as a Nutgmeg, and having Sealed up it's Stem, we held it in a Flame, and as ſoon as it was ready to Melt, removed it into the open Air, where the Bubble, which was dilated in the Flame by the help of the included Air's ſpring, was preſſed in on one ſide by the Weight of the Ambient Atmoſphere, the Rarified Air, being condenſed, and not able to reſiſt the Preſſure of the External Air; yet when the Bubble was again convey'd into the Flames, the Internal Air expanding plumped up the ſides of the Glaſs, which were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain compreſs'd and bruiſed by the Weight of the open Atmoſphere; and this Experiment being tried a Third time, Anſwered as when Firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, till at laſt the one ſide of the Bubble had a hole made in it, by the violent Preſſure of the Atmoſphere; from whence it appears, that the ſame quantity of Air may, by being Rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and leaving Vacuities betwixt it's Rarified
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:59609:417"/>Parts, be able to take up and poſſeſs a larger ſpace; and that there muſt be Vacuities inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed betwixt the Parts of that Air, is evident, ſince the Pores of the Glaſs are too ſine, to admit External Air, or when the Bubble was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, to give way for an egreſs of the Air con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it.</p>

                        <note place="margin">A Second Argument Anſwered.</note>Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> aſſerting, that the Cavity of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver exhauſted, is full of Air, the firſt Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment here alledg'd againſt him, and which ſhews, that the Weight and preſſure of the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere</hi> is very conſiderable is this: A Pewter Porringer being cemented down upon an Iron Plate, which was fixed to the Pump, we drew out the Air, upon which the Incumbent <hi>Atſmoſphere</hi> depreſs'd the Convex ſurface of the Porringer, and rendred it Concave; and in another Tryal I took Notice, that the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> did not exert its Gravity in a perpendicular Line, but collaterally.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> Explanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Torrecelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</note>Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s Explanation of the <hi>Torrecellian</hi> Experiment having been elſewhere Anſwered, to what hath been their delivered, I ſhall add the following Experiment; The <hi>Torrecillian</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment being Tried with a ſtraight Tube, we raiſed the Pipe a little in the ſtagnant Mercury; and then conveying a piece of a Bladder under the End of it, and tying it firmly; when the end of the Tube was raiſed above the ſtagnant Mercury, I obſerv'd, that the Weight of the Mercury upon the Bladder was very ſlight, and the <hi>Equilibrum</hi> betwixt the Mercurial and <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſpherical</hi> Cylinder was ſo equal, that if the Tube was but inclined, ſo that the Weight of the Mercury was not Perpendicular, the <hi>Atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere</hi> would buoy up the Bladder, and form a Concave in the lower end of the Mercury; but when the Tube was Erected again, the Bladder would be depreſs'd, and become Protuberant: And if the Bladder was nimbly apply'd, when the Mercury was a little below it's wonted Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Mercury being then lighter than the <hi>Atmoſpherical</hi> Cylinder, the Bladder would be raiſed up into the Cavity of the Tube: In which Experiment we may Obſerve, that tho' upon the Aſcent and Deſcent of the Mercury, the Cavity above it is accordingly varied in it's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions; yet no Air can Aſcend to fill it, as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> would ſuggeſt, ſince the Bottom of the Tube is ſhut up with a Bladder, which as I have elſewhere made it appear, cannot be pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated by Air.</p>
                     <p>Another Argument againſt Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of the <hi>Torrecellian</hi> Experiment, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:59609:418"/>deduced from an Obſervation made on the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling Baroſcope; for it is Obſerved, that when the ſhorter Leg is Sealed up with Air included in it, Heat will ſo Rariſie that Air, that it will elevate the Mercury in the longer Leg, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making it's way through the Mercury below, as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> ſuppoſes it does in the <hi>Torrecellian</hi> Experiment; where one would expect, that if Air condenſed could Penetrate Mercury ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the rarified Air would rather penetrate than buoy it up.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Reaſon of Suction.</note>To ſhew, in Oppoſition to Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> how much the <hi>Atmoſpherical</hi> Air is concern'd in Sucti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we took a Glaſs Bubble, whoſe long Stem, was Cylindrical and very ſlender, and having, by the help of heat, expelled a good quantity of the Air contain'd in it, when by immerg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in Water that Rarified Air which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in it, was condens'd; the VVater was almoſt raiſed to the Top of the Pipe; when this was done, the Air in the Bubble being Rarified, it forced out almoſt all the Water in the Stem, only a few Drops, which ſatisfi'd us that none of the Rarified Air had got out of the Pipe; as the Depreſſion of the Water ſo low aſſured us, on the other ſide, that the included Air was almoſt as much Expanded, as when the Water began to aſcend into the Pipe. When the Air was thus Rarified, we preſently removed the Pipe out of the Water into the Stagant Mercury, which aſcended into it in a ſhort time. In which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, did the Mercury riſe to prevent a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> or did it's Aſcent, depend on any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Principle of Motion, or on the compreſſion
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:59609:418"/>and propagated Pulſion of the Air that was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, there would be no reaſon, why the Mercury ſhould not riſe as high as the Water. But from our Hypotheſis, the Reaſon is plain; for as ſoon as the Cylinder of Water or Mercury together with the compreſs'd Air is equiponderant with the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> incumbent, it riſes no higer; So that tho' the Air is leſs condens'd, when the Tube is immers'd in Mercury; yet the greater Weight of Mercury making a greater reſiſtance than Water, the external Air is not able to buoy it up any higher to compreſs the Air en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed.</p>
                     <p>And this Experiment is confirm'd by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: For having expell'd a little Air out of the Bubble by heat, ſo much Quickſilver aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into it, as fill'd a Fourth Part of the Pipe; which being carefully removed, ſo that no Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury could run out; we cauſed the Air in the globous part to be Rarified till almoſt all the Mercury was expell'd, the end of the Pipe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the while immers'd in Water; as ſoon as the Air included began to cool, the Water roſe up into the Body of the Ball, buoying up the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury before it, whereit was obſerv'd, that as the Air was more or leſs Rarifi'd, and the Quickſilver exepll'd out of the Stem, the Aſcent, of the Water would proportionably vary. So that as the Body to be buoy'd up by the External Air varies in Weight, ſo do the Degrees of it's Aſcent.</p>
                     <p>Another Obſervation, which ſhews that there is no Circulation of Wind, ſuch as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to be the Cauſe of Suction, is, that Smoak will aſcend without being in the leaſt blown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. But ſince Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> will not allow of a <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum,</hi>
                        <pb n="234" facs="tcp:59609:419"/>but aſſerts, that the Air makes it's Way through the cloſe and ſolid Bodies, I ſhall add, that having expell'd the Air by Rarefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, out of a very thin <hi>Aeopile,</hi> and ſtopp'd the Orifice up with Wax, the External Air made ſuch a violent Preſſure on it, as to thruſt the Sides of it conſiderably inwards.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> The Cauſe of Attraction by Suction.</head>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Attraction, what.</note>SUction being look'd upon to be a ſort of Attraction, before I deſcend to a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Conſideration of the former, I ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſomething of the latter.</p>
                     <p>And tho' Attraction is generally taken to be a kind of Pulſion, yet both of them to me ſeem to be but extrinſical Denominations of the ſame Local Motion; in which, if a Body mov'd, precede the Movent, or tends to acquire a greater Diſtance from it, we call it Pulſion; and if upon the Account of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ſame Body either follows, or tends towards the Movent, it is term'd Attraction; ſo that the difference is no Phyſical one, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Accidental,</hi> in reſpect of the Line of Motion to the Movent. As when a Man draws a Chain after him, tho' he goes before it, yet he hath ſome Part of his Body behind one Link, which draws the reſt after it; and ſo if that Chain draws any thing after it, tho' the Cauſe of the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:59609:419"/>Attraction goes before, yet there is a certain Coheſion of Parts, that enables it to drag that Body after it; ſo that Attraction evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be a Species of Pulſion, and ſuch an one as is uſually term'd Truſion, as when a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner drives his Wheelbarrow before him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out letting go his Hold.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps it may be ſaid, that there are At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions where it cannot be pretended that the Attrahent comes behind any Part of the Body attracted; as in Magnetical and Electrical At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions, or as when Water riſes by pumping.</p>
                     <p>As for the two firſt Inſtances, ſhould we allow with Modern Philoſophers, of ſcrew'd Particles and other Magnetical Emiſſions, we might ſay, that theſe coming behind either the Body attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or it's porous Parts on it's Superficies might cauſe ſuch an Effect; or by procuring ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of the Air, that may make it thruſt the moveable towards the Attracting Body. But were there none of theſe, nor any other ſubtil Agents, that cauſe this Motion by a real, tho' unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd Pulſion; I ſhould, to diſtinguiſh theſe from other Attractions, term them Attraction by Inviſibles.</p>
                     <p>But as for the laſt Inſtance, I ſuppoſe it will be eaſily granted, that the aſcending Rammer only makes way for the Water to riſe, as it is buoy'd up by External Air; for from the <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recellian</hi> Experiment it is evident, that, ſince the Terraqueous Globe is continually preſs'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> if in any part, that Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure be taken off, the Incumbent Atmoſpherical Pillar will buoy up as much of that Liquor, as a Pillar of Air of ſuch a Diameter is able to
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:59609:420"/>counterpoiſe: The Truth of which is further confirm'd by obſerving, that, if the Air from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Syringe be exhauſted, the Sucker may be pull'd up without elevating the Water, or draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it up after it. And indeed, ſuppoſing two Men, by thruſting equally on each ſide a Door, to keep it ſhut, one might as well ſay, that he that left off thruſting on one ſide, was the Cauſe of the Doors opening, as that the Water riſes by the drawing up the Rammer, which only gives way to the Water as buoy'd up by the External Air.</p>
                     <p>Thus much being ſaid of Attraction, I ſhall proceed to conſider,<note place="margin">The Cauſe of Suction, as laid down by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anun'd.</note> that Species of it call'd <hi>Suction;</hi> for which ſeveral Philoſophers have thought on various Cauſes. As Nature's Abhorrency of a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> which, were it true, Water by Suction might be rais'd to any Height; but we have found by Experience, that it will not be rais'd above 33 ½ Foot, which Weight the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> is able to buoy up; as appears from the <hi>Torre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellian</hi> Experiment. And further from an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment elſewhere laid down, where, tho' Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may preſently be ſuck'd up to the Top of a Pipe 3 Foot long, yet Mercury being too heavy to be buoy'd up ſo high, it will not be elevated higher than an Atmoſpherical Cylinder is able to raiſe it.</p>
                     <p>But thoſe Modern Philoſophers who allow not a <hi>Fuga Vacui,</hi> aſcribe the Aſcent of ſuch Liquors to an Impulſe or Propagation of Motion, by the Dilation of the <hi>Thorax;</hi> for they think, that the Lungs drawing in the Air, the dilated <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax</hi> propagates the Impulſe, till it reaches ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively the Body ſuck'd; for ſuch thinking the Univerſe totally a <hi>Plenum,</hi> think that ſuch Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:59609:420"/>not finding any other Place to move in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, does upon that ſcore buoy up the Water or Mercury in the Pipe. But if we conſider, how vaſt the Dimenſions of the Air are, and compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively how inconſiderable an Impulſe the <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax</hi> by dilating can make, it will ſcarce be thought, that ſo ſlight a one will compreſs the whole Air, ſo much as to make it impel the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſuck'd vigorouſly enough to riſe to that height, which Liquors may be rais'd to by Suction. But the Aſcent of ſuch Liquors evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently depends on this, that by Suction the Preſſure is taken off the Surface of the Water, within the Pipe, and conſequently, it muſt riſe and be buoy'd up by the Preſſure of the <hi>Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere,</hi> on the ſtagnant Water.</p>
                     <p>To countenance my Opinion, and to refute the others I have mention'd, I ſhall offer the following Experiment, <hi>viz.</hi> A ſmall Bubble with a Stem being ſeal'd up, when the Air was forc'd out by Rarefaction, the Stem was broke under Water, upon which the Water ruſh'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cavity of the Bubble, where if it be ſaid to go into the Bubble to prevent a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> thoſe that ſay ſo, allow <hi>dari Vacuum,</hi> and ſubvert their own Principles; and as for the Pleniſts, upon the ſame Account we may ask them, what became of that Air which was expell'd out of the Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and remain'd ſo, till the Stem was broke; ſince were the World an abſolute <hi>Plenum</hi> before, there could be no room for it without, nor could there be ſuch an empty Space within to receive the Water. Beſides, if they ſay the external Air being condens'd and compreſs'd by that which is forced out of the Bubble, occaſions the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:59609:421"/>Re-ingreſs of Water when the Stem is broke off, it may juſtly be wonder'd, that a cubic Inch of Air ſhould be able to condenſe the Air ſo much, that a Mile's diſtance from the place the Bubble was evacuated in, it ſhould be able to preſs the Water thus in again. But by our <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis,</hi> it is accounted for without theſe Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; ſince the Reſiſtance of the rarifi'd Air within the Bubble, being diſproportionable to the Preſſure of the leſs rarifi'd Ambient Air, it muſt conſequently yield to it, and give way to the Ingreſs of Water.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Our own O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd and prov'd.</note>From what hath been ſaid, it plainly appears what our <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> is, which that I may confirm by the following Experiments I ſhall briefly intimate: That the Aſcent of Liquors by Suction, in a Word, depends on the External Preſſure of the Air, when it is taken off the internal Superficies of the Liquor in that Tube; what that Preſſure depends on we have elſewhere prov'd in our <hi>Phyſico</hi>-Mechanical Experiments of the Air's Spring and Weight, and therefore ſhall proceed to Experiments to confirm what we teach of <hi>Suction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We took then a crooked Syphon, whoſe ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Leg was parallel to the longer, which being hermetically ſeal'd, and ſo much Water conveigh'd into the crooked End, that it was of an equal Height in both Legs, ſo much Air was contain'd in the Cavity of the ſhorter Leg, as poſſeſſes an Inch and ½. The Inſtrument being thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd, one was order'd to ſuck at the Top of the longer Leg, and by all the Force and reiterated Suctions, he was not able to raiſe the Water higher than the Air in the ſhorter Leg depreſs'd
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:59609:421"/>the Surface of that; for when the Spring of that Air was ſo far weaken'd, that it could not depreſs the Water ſubjacent; the Water kept at the ſame Station, being not above four Inches high, which was not two Inches and an half higher than at firſt. But as ſoon as the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Preſſure of the <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> was again ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Surface of the Water in the longer Tube, it was preſently depreſs'd, and the Air in the ſhorter Leg condens'd, till the Water like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe roſe in that to it's firſt Station.</p>

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The third confirm'd.</note>For a further Confirmation of the Doctrin laid down in this Propoſition, I ſhall ſubjovn the following Experiment. We made uſe of a Travelling Baroſcope, whoſe ſhorter Leg was 2 Inches above the Surface of the ſtagnant Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury; and having ſeal'd up the End of the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Leg, we open'd the End of the longer; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which, the Weight of the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> being added to the Preſſure made by the Cylinder of Mercury, the Air contain'd in the ſhorter Leg was compreſs'd into half the Space it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd before. This Experiment being try'd a ſecond time had the like Succeſs.</p>
                     <p>To make it further appear, how much the Aſcent of Liquors depends on Preſſure. I took
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:59609:422"/>a Glaſs Syphon like the former, and having her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metically ſeal'd up the ſhorter Leg, I pour'd in ſo much Mercury as compreſs'd the Air in the ſhorter Leg, into half the Space it poſſeſs'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; the Mercury in the longer Leg being at the ſame time, about 30 Inches higher than in the other; nevertheleſs, the Mercury could not be rais'd by Suction above one Inch higher in the longer Leg; whereas, did the Aſcent of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors depend on Nature's Abhorrency of a <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum,</hi> it would have roſe much higher, there being no danger of leaving a <hi>Vacuum</hi> in the ſhorter Leg, ſince the Air was compreſs'd into half the Space it naturally poſſeſſes; ſo that the Reaſon according to our <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be this, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Preſſure of the Cylinder of Mercury, and the compreſs'd Air being in a <hi>due Aequilibrium,</hi> when, by ſucking, the Air is drawn out of the longer, the Air in the ſhorter expands it ſelf ſo much, as Preſſure is taken off by the Removal of that Air, and when it is expanded ſo far, the Pillar of Mercury keeps it from expanding any further, ſo that, there being no other Force to raiſe and preſs the Mercury up, it can be elevated no higher, ſince the Air included in the ſhorter Leg acts only by Virtue of it's Spring, and not as in the open <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> by Virtue of it's Spring and Weight too, ſo when it hath loſt it's Spring, it can propel the Mercury no higher.</p>
                     <p>To conclude this Diſcourſe, I ſhall here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain one <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> in <hi>Vacuo Boyliano,</hi> which to ſome ſeems an Argument of Nature's Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of a <hi>Vacuum.</hi> The <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> is, That if ones Finger be apply'd to the Orifice of the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:59609:423"/>Pipe, that conveighs Air from the Receiver to the Pump, the Pulp of one Finger, will enter a good way into the Pipe, and be very pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; the Protuberant Part of it ſeeming to be drawn in by Attraction. To which we give this brief Anſwer, <hi>viz.</hi> That when firſt the Finger is plac'd there, it receives an equal Preſſure from the Air within the Pipe, and from the <hi>Atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere;</hi> but when that Air is drawn away, the External Preſſure finding no Reſiſtance, preſſes the fleſhy Part into the Tube, which is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly painful, as the External Preſſure in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the internal Reſiſtance is greater or leſs.</p>
                     <p>To illuſtrate this Explication, I ſhall add, that having clos'd up one End of a Glaſs Pipe, whoſe Diameter was an Inch, with a piece of oyl'd Bladder, and fill'd it full of Water; it was immers'd in a tall Veſſel full of Water, the immers'd End of the Tube reaching almoſt to the Bottom of the Veſſel, and the other End emerging, and ſtanding open above the Veſſel: This being done, we took Water out of the Tube, till the Surface of it was conſiderably lower than the Surface of the Water in the Glaſs Body; upon which, the Bladder being more ſtrongly preſs'd againſt by the Water in the Veſſel, than that in the Tube, the Bladder was forc'd ſo much into the Cavity of the Tube, as to form a Semi-Globe; but if, when the Water in the Tube, and that in the Veſſel were equally pois'd, the uppermoſt Orifice of the Tube were ſtopp'd, tho' the Pipe were ſo much immers'd, that the Quantity of Water, which preſs'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the lower ſide of the Bladder, were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:59609:423"/>than that in the Tube; yet would not the Bladder have the leaſt Protuberance; but if the Orifice of the Tube were left open to the Air, the Bladder would ſuddenly be preſs'd ſo much into the Hollow of the Pipe, that it's Convex Superficies would repreſent a Semi-Circle. The ſame Experiment being try'd with a Tube, the lower End of which was ſo bent, as to form a right Angle, the Succeſs was the ſame: Nor did it vary when try'd in the ſtraight Pipe, with Wine inſtead of Water, ſave that Wine not being ſpecifically aeque-ponderant with Water, a greater Quantity of Wine was requiſite to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle them, at firſt, in a juſt <hi>Aequilibrium;</hi> but when that <hi>Aequilibrium</hi> was loſt, by immerging the Tube into the Water, the Bladder was rais'd, ſo as to become protuberant in the Cavity of the Pipe.</p>

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:59609:424"/>Length of the Atmoſperical Pillar of Air that preſſes upon it, the height of the Mercury may vary; tho' not always exactly; for ſometimes upon Changes in the Air not otherwiſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, the Mercury will ſubſide more than u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually in that which ſtands furtheſt from the Center of the Earth, when at the ſame time it does not proportionably ſubſide in that which is plac'd in a lower Situation. And</p>
                     <p>It, perhaps, may be Worth Noting, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon exceſſive Droughts, when the Ground is parch'd and crack'd, ſome ſubterraneal <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvia</hi> may not riſe, which may add a ſpecifick Gravity to the Air.</p>
                     <p>Nor will it be needleſs, when other Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are making, at the ſame time to obſerve the Weather; as alſo what Winds blow, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther violent or more remiſs; for ſometimes it is obſerv'd, that when high Winds blow, the Mercury is the lower, tho' not always.</p>
                     <p>But to favour what hath been intimated, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Alterations in the Weight of the Air, depend on ſubterraneal Steams mix'd with it; It hath been obſerv'd, that after long Droughts, upon a Shower of Rain, ſo many Steams have been either prevented from riſing, or depreſs'd and precipitated, that the Mercury hath ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded within 2/16 of an Inch.</p>

By which means I could diſcern Variations, by which the Altitude of the Mercury was not alter'd above ¼ of an Inch. And it was not a little pleaſant to behold, that ſometimes the Bubble would be counterpois'd; but when the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high, it would manifeſtly preponderate, and upon other Changes the Scales would preponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate on the other ſide, and in ſome Days time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain regain it's <hi>Aequilibrium;</hi> ſo that by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt on the ſtatical Baroſcope, one might foretel, whether in the Mercurial Baroſcope the Water were higher or lower; but of all the Seaſons we made our Obſervations in, the moſt frequent Changes were in the Spring.</p>
                     <p>This ſtatical Baroſcope having exactly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd upon frequent Obſervations, I ſhall add the following Notes concerning the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                        <item>And firſt, as to the Grounds on which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in making this Baroſcope.
<list>
                              <item>1. That the Glaſs Bubble and it's Glaſs Counterpoiſe are not
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:59609:425"/>of the ſame Bulk, the Bubble being a hundred times bigger than the Counterpoiſe.</item>
                              <item>2. If Bodies of equal Weight and unequal Bulks be weigh'd in another <hi>Medium,</hi> the <hi>Aequilibrium</hi> will be loſt; for if the new <hi>Medium</hi> be heavier, the Body whoſe Dimenſions were larger, will be lighter than before; and <hi>Vice versâ,</hi> and the Diſparity of Weight in the new <hi>Medium</hi> will be greater, as the Inequality of Bulk betwixt the two Bodies varies.</item>
                              <item>3. Theſe two things being laid together, I conſider'd, that it would be the ſame thing in reference to the Effects, what <hi>Medium</hi> theſe Bodies were weigh'd in, provided the difference were conſiderable; and conſequently, ſince the Baroſcope made it evident, that the Weight of the Air vary'd, the Bubble and it's Counterpoiſe would be differently affected upon thoſe Variations, and would accordingly preponderate, the Bubble being ſubject to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderate when the Air was lighter; and <hi>Vice versâ.</hi>

                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Bubble was about the ſize of a large Orange, and weig'd 1 Drachm and 10 Grains.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If I had had, any Opportunities, I would have try'd whether the <hi>Aequilibrium</hi> of theſe two Bodies would have been alter'd, by the Drineſs or Moiſture of the Air.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> When I could not get one Bubble large enough, I have made uſe of two leſs, which tho' they are not altogether ſo convenient, yet, if the Scales be ſtrong enough to bear the Weight, they will anſwer the Deſign of the Experiment.</item>
                        <pb n="247" facs="tcp:59609:425"/>
                     </list>
                     <p>This Inſtrument may be improv'd by ſeveral Accomodations. As,</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>First,</hi> To the <hi>Anſa</hi> of the Ballance, an Arch of a Circle may be fitted, which being divided into 15 or 20 Degrees, will readily tell the Quantity of the Angle, and how much the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Cock declines from a Perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> A Counterpoiſe of Gold may be made uſe of.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Ballance being made of Copper or Braſs, will in time vary leſs in it's Exactneſs, than if it be made of Steel, which is more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ruſt.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Bubble and it's Counterpoiſe may be ſuſpended at the Beam, by which means it will be leſs burthen'd with Weight.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The whole Inſtrument will be more free from Duſt and irregular Agitations, if placed in a Frame, like a Square Lanthorn, with Glaſs Windows and a Hole at the Top to give an Intercourſe betwixt External and Internal Air.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Sixthly,</hi> This Inſtrument having a light Wheel and an Index fitted to it, ſuch as Dr. <hi>Wren</hi> us'd to open Weather-Glaſſes with, and the Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Mr. <hi>Hook,</hi> apply'd to Baroſcopes, will diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more minute Variations.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Seventhly,</hi> The Beam may be improv'd by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made longer, and it's Ballance may be more exquiſite than thoſe I generally employ'd.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Thus, tho' this ſtatical Baroſcope be inferior to the Mercurial one in ſome Reſpects, yet in others it is more convenient; For</p>
                     <pb n="248" facs="tcp:59609:426"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> It demonſtrates to Autopſie, that the Aſcent and Deſcent of the Mercury, depends on the varying Weight of the <hi>Atmoſphere;</hi> ſince here it cannot be pretended, that the Changes depend on a <hi>Fuga Vacui. Secondly,</hi> It ſhews that the Air hath Weight, and much more than ſome Learned Men would allow; ſince in ſo ſmall a Quantity of it, we ſee conſiderable Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is more eaſily, provided; and more conveniently removed. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We are more eaſily ſatisfied of the Goodneſs of them. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The <hi>Abſolute</hi> or <hi>Reſpective</hi> Weight of the Air may more eaſily be diſcover'd; if, when the Weight and Dimenſions of the Bubble is Hydroſtatically diſcover'd, upon every Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Mercury's Height in the mercurial Baroſcope, the ſtatical Baroſcope's <hi>Aequilibrium</hi> be reſtored by the Addition of Weights; that Weight in the ſtatical Baroſcope anſwering the Variations in the Aſcent or Deſcent of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury in the other. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> By this Inſtrument, we may compare the mercurial Baroſcopes of ſeveral Places, and be able to make ſome Eſtimate of the Gravities of the Air therein; for, if in one place the Bubble weighs a Drachm, when the Mercury is 29 ½ Inches high, and that when the Mercury is riſen an <hi>8th,</hi> it is requiſite to add the ſixteenth Part of a Grain to preſerve the <hi>Aequilibrium;</hi> When I come to another Place, and find the ſame Proportions anſwer, I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that there is no ſenſible Difference in the Weight of the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> in thoſe Places; but if an additional Weight be requir'd to preſerve the <hi>Aequilibrium,</hi> then the Air is ſo much hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:59609:426"/>than when the Mercury ſtood at 92 ½ Inches.</p>
                     <p>But in making theſe Obſervations we muſt take notice, whether the Places in which they are made, are equally diſtant from the Center of the Earth; for if one be a Valley, and the other a Hill, there will happen a difference upon that Account.</p>
                     <p>There is yet another uſe which may be made of this ſtatical Baroſcope, which is, to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Weight of the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> at the Top and Bottoms of high Mountains; but whether that may contribute to the diſcovering the Height of Mountains, or not, I ſhall leave to be conſider'd with more leiſure.</p>

This being done, and the Water in both freed from Air, we took them out, and filling up the Stem of the Glaſs Egg, with Water out of the Bottle, we invert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it into more of the ſame; ſo that the Glaſs Egg and Stem was wholly full, except that a Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Air was contain'd in the Top of the Egg, whoſe Dimenſions were a Tenth and leſs than two Centeſms of an Inch. Then the Glaſſes being placed in the Receiver, we ſet the Engin on Work; and obſerv'd, that the Bubble gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually expanded, till it fill'd up the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of the Egg, except the Stem; and leſt the Water ſhould be thought to ſubſide only for want of the Internal Air to bear it up, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd pumping, till the Bubble in the Egg expanding further, depreſs'd the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Water in the Stem, below the Surface of the External Water. The Air be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus far rarifi'd, we compar'd the Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Bubble with the Diameter of the Glaſs, and found it to be as 1 to 20; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, according to <hi>Euclid,</hi> the Proportion betwixt Spheres being triplicate to that of their
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:59609:427"/>Diameters, the Diameter of the leſſer being one, the Diameter of the other muſt be 8000. So that the Air expanded, poſſeſs'd 8000 times the Space it poſſeſs'd before. The Glaſs Egg being fill'd with ſuch Water again, and no Air included in it, tho' the Receiver was in a great meaſure exhauſted, yet the Water did not ſubſide, till a Bubble at the laſt roſe to the Top, whoſe Diameter was to the Diameter of the Glaſs as 1 to 14, ſo that according to <hi>Euclid</hi>'s Rule before-mention'd, the Bubble expanded, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd 2744 times as much Space as before.

                     <p>A Glaſs Bubble newly blown, and whilſt it contain'd none but rarifi'd Air, had it's Stem imediately clapt into a Flame, and Seal'd up; Many Months after it was inverted into a Baſin of Water, and the Seal broke off under the Surface of it; and tho' Water was violently impell'd into the Cavity of it, yet the included Air had ſo far retain'd it's Spring, as not to ſuffer the Cavity to be quite filled with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>Another Method I took to ſhew the Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of the Air's Spring was the following, <hi>viz.</hi> Leaving a ſmall Portion of Air in the Folds
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:59609:429"/>of a Lamb's Bladder, whoſe Neck was cloſely ty'd; it was inclos'd in another Veſſel, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh'd into our Pneumatick Engin, and when the Receiver was exhauſted, the expanded Air diſtended the Bladder, ſo that it fill'd the whole Cavity of the Veſſel, by whoſe ſides, it was guarded from the Preſſure of the outward Air, ſo that the expanded Air kept the Bladder di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtended two Years.</p>
                     <p>For further Satisfaction, I contriv'd an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by which I could learn, whether, and how long Air variouſly expanded will retain it's Spring; by which I could not diſcover, that the Air loſt any thing conſiderable of it's Spring, in ten Weeks time.</p>
                     <p>Another Inſtrument I made uſe of, by which I could find, that Air expanded to 1000 times it's uſual Dimenſions, would be ſenſibly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Heat, and loſe the Expanſion it gain'd thereby, upon a Removal of that Heat.</p>

                        <hi>March</hi> 18. We try'd the following Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. A Cylindrical Glaſs having a long Stem at the unſeal'd End, was fill'd with Water, and inverted into Water, which lay in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of a large Pipe, ſeal'd at one End, and 3 or 4 Foot long; which being done, the large Pipe was ſo far exhauſted, that the Air the inverted Pipe poſſeſs'd the whole Cavity of it down to the Stem; upon which the larger Tube being clos'd up, the expanded Air poſſeſs'd the ſame Space 3 Months after, except that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Pipe and the Stem, upon extream Cold, the Water roſe ⅛ or near ¼. The clos'd <hi>Apex</hi> being broke open under Water, it gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually fill'd the whole Cavity, except a ſmall
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:59609:429"/>Space poſſeſs'd by a little Bubble. The Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Cylindrical Part of the Pipe was ⅗ of an Inch, and its Length 3 Inches; the Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was about 2/10 in Diameter, and 2/100 in Depth; ſo that the Bubble was, according to <hi>Dr Wallis</hi> his Computation, to the Space it poſſeſſed, when expanded, as 1 to 1350.</p>

                        </note>TO try how far the Air is capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condens'd by mere Cold, when the Seaſon of the Year hath not pre-affected it; I try'd the following Experiment in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the middle of <hi>September</hi> about Noon, on a Sun-ſhiny Day, we placed a Bolt head in a Frame, ſo that the Stem was Perpendicular to the Horizon, and the lower End of it immers'd in Water. This done, we cover'd the Ball of the Bolt-head with a Mixture of beaten Ice and <hi>Bay-Salt;</hi> upon which, the internal Air being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens'd, the Water roſe up into the Stem, and ſtood a good while: Then having made a Mark at it's higheſt Station, we fill'd the Veſſel with Water, and found that it yielded ℥19 and <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>vj, the Weight of the Water which fill'd the Stem up to the Mark being ℥j and <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iij, by
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:59609:430"/>which Number, the former being divided, the Quotient was 14 4/11 Drachms; ſo that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the two Quantities being as, 11 to 158; The Space into which the Air was condens'd, was, to it's former Space, as 147 to 158: So that the higheſt Degree of Condenſation it was then capable of, made it loſe of it's former Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent 11/158.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>N. B. First,</hi> The Stem of the Glaſs ought to be long, leſt the Water, upon the Air's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſation, ſhould riſe into the Ball of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Cylinder of Water was two Foot, ſo that it might, by it's Weight, in ſome meaſure, hinder the Aſcent of more, and ſo keep the Air from condenſing to it's ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When the Water roſe as high as it well could, we obſerv'd it to riſe and fall alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, for a little time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Air may thus be further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens'd, than by Winters Cold.</p>
                     <p>But to ſhew that in the forgoing Experiment, the Cold did not compreſs the Air immediately, but partly, in as much as it, by ſtuffing up the Pores of the Water, caus'd it to ſwell, and ſo to compreſs the Air; I took a new Glaſs Bolt-head with a ſhort Neck, and fill'd it full of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſo that when it was hermetically ſeal'd up, the Liquor wrought within 3 Inches of the Top, the ſharp End which was made for the Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of ſealing being ¼ of an Inch long; This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, the Bolt-head was plac'd in a Mixture of Snow and Salt, upon which, the Water aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended and compreſs'd the Air into the Coni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Part; upon which, the Glaſs flew in pieces.
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:59609:430"/>In which Experiment, according to Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> his Eſtimate, the Air was compreſs'd into a 40th part of the Space it poſſeſs'd before. Which is conſiderable above the utmoſt Compreſſure made in Wind-Guns, where it is uſually thought not to be compreſs'd into leſs than a 15th, and (according to <hi>Merſennus</hi>) into an 8th part of it's former Space.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Air may be much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens'd and rarifi'd by our Engins, than by Heat or Cold; the Proportion in reſpect of Expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion being as 1 to 70.</p>
                     <p>But, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Perhaps the Proportion betwixt the Degrees of the Air's Condenſation and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refaction will not be thought ſo great, as what we have mention'd; if we conſider, that the Air we make Experiments with here below, is ſo much compreſs'd already, by the Incumbent
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:59609:431"/>
                        <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> that for that Reaſon it is more inclin'd by it's Spring to yeild to an Expanſive, than a Compreſſive Force.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It may be queſtion'd, how the parts of the Air, which have a ſpecifick Gravity, come to be ſpread ſo thin in the Cavity of the exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Receiver, ſince there is nothing in it for them to ſwim in, and to bear them up; Since the Proportion is ſo great betwixt the Parts of the Air, and the Cavity of the Receiver, they are contain'd in.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It is not a little wonderful, that Air ſhould be ſo ſubject to vary it's Dimenſions; ſo that if we conſider how far it may be expanded without the Aſſiſtance of Art, elaborate Engins or Heat, the Top of the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely rare.</p>
                     <p>To conclude; If we compare the utmoſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Condenſation and Rarefaction toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the ſame Portion of Air may poſſeſs 520000 times the Space, at one time, that it did at another.</p>

For uſually in the Summer, when the Hygroſcope is lighteſt, the Baroſcope is higher, tho' ſtrong Winds may make both lighter, ſuch as the <hi>North-West</hi> with us; whereas <hi>South</hi> Winds with Rain uſually make the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſcope lighter, and the Spunge heavier.

                        <p>But tho' it be poſſible thus to make Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of Particular Winds; yet it requires a great deal of Caution, as well as Skill in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick and Coſmography, in forming Rules for the obſerving of the Qualities of other Bodies, ſince Winds which come from the ſame Quarters in ſeveral Countries have different Qualities; for tho' <hi>North</hi> Winds in the Winter, are generally attended with Froſt, yet at the Famous Port of <hi>Archangel</hi> a Thaw accompany'd it; the Reaſon of which ſeems to be no other than, that the <hi>Northern</hi> Wind coming a long way over the <hi>Northern</hi> Seas, does not acquire ſuch a Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the <hi>South</hi> Wind, which paſſes over a large Tract of Frozen Land. And it is obſerv'd in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that the <hi>North</hi> Winds which are elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where drying, are there moiſt, which is atteſted by Mr. <hi>Sands</hi> in his Travels into <hi>Aegypt, lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Cap.</hi> 8. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3.

                        <p>But, beſides that on this account Winds from the ſame Quarters may differently affect the Hygroſcope; It's Operation may be conſiderably diverſify'd, as it blows vehemently or ſlowly over the ſame Country; for tho Wind would rather increaſe the Weight of a Hygroſcope if mov'd ſlowly, yet by a more vehement Agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſeveral moiſt Particles in the Spunge are diſſipated and diſperſed. To theſe Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I ſhall add the following, <hi>Viz.</hi> that froſty Weather hath been obſerv'd to make the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſcope grow lighter towards Night, and that ſnowy Weather increas'd the Weight of it, as likewiſe miſty and foggy Weather.</p>
                        <p>But what is more ſtrange is, that on a Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiny day, the Spunge hath preponderated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the paſſing by of a Cloud; but as ſoon as that was gone, regain'd it's <hi>Aequilibrium;</hi> and I have obſerv'd, that when the Air hath grown heavier, the Hygroſcope hath grown lighter, as if thoſe Terreſtrial <hi>Effluvia</hi> which increaſe the Weight of the Air were unfit to be imbib'd into the Pores of the Spunge; wherefore at ſuch times it may not be amiſs to take notice; whether any, and if any, what kind of Meteor, as Wind, or Rain or Hail, or in the Winter, Snow or Froſt, will commonly be ſignifi'd or produc'd.</p>

                        <p>To conclude this Chapter, I ſhall intimate, that tho' in theſe Matters it be perhaps impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to form <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> which can in no Points

<pb n="273" facs="tcp:59609:439"/>Pair of Scales, and counterpois'd, makes a good Hygroſcope; and not only theſe, but Lute-ſtrings, which are made of the twiſted Guts of Animals, and even Bones, the moſt ſolid Parts of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Bodies, will ſo far imbibe the Moiſture of the Air, as to ſwell conſiderably.</p>
                     <p>Nor are Animal Bodies alone capable of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Pores penetrated by the Moiſture of the Air; but it inſinuates it ſelf into inanimate Bodies, and ſwells the ſolid Parts of Wood; and even Poliſh'd Marbles are obſerv'd to be ſo plentifully ſtock'd with moiſt Vapours, as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to ſweat; nay even the Air it ſelf is not without Vapours and moiſt Parts, diſpers'd through it in the Heat of Summer, which will appear from the following Experiment.</p>
                     <p>Having fill'd a Bottle with Water and four Ounces of <hi>Sal Armon.</hi> we counterpois'd it in a Pair of Scales, and in an Hours time, ſo many moiſt Particles in the Air were condens'd by this frigorifick Mixture, that, they firſt appear'd in the form of a Dew, on the outſide of the Glaſs, and then ran down the ſides of the Veſſel, till that Scale preponderated and weigh'd a Drachm more than the other.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed to Inſtances, which, ſhew the Force and Efficacy of moiſt Vapours, when they penetrate ſolid Bodies. It is no weak Argument of their Efficacy that we obſerve, that, by the powerful Inſinuation of Moiſture, the Strings of Muſical Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſwollen and broken; nor is it in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, that Doors and Door-Caſes are ſo ſwol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len in Rainy Weather, as to open and ſhut with a great deal of uneaſineſs.</p>

And not only by the help of Rain, but the Moiſture of the Air, Marchaſites have been ſwollen and burſt aſunder; which I am apter to believe, becauſe I have obſerv'd Vitriolate Effloreſcences upon the Surfaces of ſhining Marchaſites, caus'd by the Action of external Moiſture on them; and the Moiſture of the Air hath ſo powerfully penetrated ſome Marchaſitical Subſtances, that they have burſt aſunder; whereupon it appear'd, that a greater Quantity of Vitriol was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated within their Subſtances, than with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>
                     <p>To conclude what I have to ſay on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I ſhall add the following Experiment to aſſiſt a <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> to make an Eſtimate in known Meaſures of the mechanical Force of the Aerial Moiſture.</p>
                     <p>I caus'd a Rope about 22 Yards long, to be faſten'd at a convenient Height, to an immovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Body; and then having fix'd a Pully to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtable Body, about 18 Yards diſtant from the former, the Rope lying upon the Pully, was, betwixt both, almoſt in an horizontal Poſture; but to that End of the Rope, which hung down from the Pully towards the Ground, was fix'd a Weight of 50 Pound, and to the upper Part of that, an <hi>Index,</hi> which being plac'd ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontally, pointed to a Board which was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Inches and parts of Inches, that we might
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:59609:440"/>diſcover the better, the Aſcent and Deſcent of it upon changes of Weather.</p>
                     <p>When the Weight had ſtretch'd the Rope as much as it could; I obſerv'd, that in one rainy Night the Weight was rais'd five Inches; but the next Day proving a dry Day, it was depreſs'd lower than before.</p>
                     <p>But a heavier Weight being made uſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the former; <hi>June</hi> 4th in an hour and quarter, the hundred Weight was rais'd ¼ of an Inch. The Sky being cloudy, but without Rain. <hi>June</hi> 6th. In the Night which was cloudy, it was rais'd about 3 Inches, and an hour after that Obſervation was made, it roſe half an Inch more.</p>
                     <p>From whence it appears, that the Force of the Air's Moiſture is conſiderable, ſince the Rope that, by it's Aſſiſtance, rais'd the Weight, was but about the third Part of an Inch Diameter, being 3/10 and 4 decimal Parts of 1/10.</p>

                        <p>And indeed, if we conſider what a great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Bodies, beſides Minerals, the Earth is ſtock'd with, tho' ſome may emit <hi>Effluvia</hi> noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to Men as well as Plants, yet in that Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:59609:441"/>there may not be a few, whoſe Exhalations may be as friendly to him; for Trees and Graſs have not only been obſerv'd to flouriſh over Tin Mines in the <hi>West</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> but over Veins of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of Mineral, which was not far from the Surface of the Earth. And it is obſerv'd, that thoſe that Work in Tin Mines, uſually live ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry long. And I have not only been told, that the Fumes that riſe from ſuch Mines, tho' often very bituminous, and of an offenſive Smell, yet ſome of them are well ſcented: And a Friend of mine, who caus'd himſelf to be let down in a ſubterraneal Cavern, which was broken open by digging for a Mine, not only obſerv'd, that the Air was very pleaſant to breath, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe amongſt ſeveral imperfectly form'd Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, ſtore of a Mineral Earth very fragrant and pleaſant, which Smell it in ſome meaſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, when it had been expos'd to the Air for ſome time.</p>
                        <p>And I my ſelf have obſerv'd in <hi>Ireland,</hi> a piece of Ground to yield very good, tho' ſhort Graſs, in a Country juſtly eſteem'd healthful, which I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to ſome ſulphureous Exhalations-from Lime-ſtone; which have had ſo conſiderable Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in other places, that I am told that a piece of Ground in <hi>Derbyſhire</hi> which lies upon Lime-ſtone, is ſo warm'd by the Vapours that riſe from it, that Snow is much ſooner Thaw'd upon it, than that which lies near it, on Soil which covers Free-ſtone. To which it may be added, that a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman obſerv'd in <hi>Hungary,</hi> that walking over ſome Ground which affords that Noble Oar call'd by the <hi>Germans Rot-gulden ertz,</hi> the Air was very pleaſant, nor was the Air much
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:59609:442"/>leſs pleaſant on that Ground which lay upon Veins of <hi>Cinnabar;</hi> yet over other ſorts of Mines the Air was very inoffenſive. Nor is it improbable, that ſubjacent Foſſiles ſhould influence the Air, ſince I have obſerv'd Mineral Earths twenty Foot deep, yield a volatile ſaline Spirit, like that of Harts-horn.</p>
                        <p>And that ſeveral <hi>Effluvia</hi> may impregnate the Air, which are not to be diſcern'd by any of our Senſes, appears from thoſe Magnetical <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvia</hi> of the Earth, diſcover'd by the Ingenious <hi>Gilbert</hi> and others, which do not only ſteam through the Air, but as I have obſerv'd, act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Bodies in an Inſtant, which are contain'd in Glaſſes hermetically ſeal'd.</p>
                        <p>But tho' from hence it may appear, that the Salubrity of the Air may be improv'd by the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of ſome Minerals; yet it is beyond doubt, that in general they render the Air In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalubrious, ſince there are a great many more that emit bad, than good ones: For beſides that the Air hath been obſerv'd in <hi>Hungary</hi> to be very offenſive and prejudicial to Reſpiration, that in the <hi>Neopolitan Grotta de Cani,</hi> ſuddenly deprives Dogs both of Senſe and Motion. To which may be added the <hi>Averni</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> which ſuddenly kill thoſe that draw in the Air infected with them. Beſides which, there are a great many noxious <hi>Effluvia</hi> which riſe from Marchaſitical Minerals, which we take little notice of, and in places which we little ſuſpect them to be in; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, they infect the Air, and render it corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, by emitting that ill condition'd Sulphur, which they ſo much abound with, that a pound diſtill'd in an Earthen Veſſel with a good Fire,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:59609:442"/>beſides an inflammable Sulphur, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens'd into thin Films on the ſide of the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, yielded a ſtrong Acid, not much unlike <hi>Gas Sulphuris,</hi> which was corroſive enough to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve Coral in the Cold. And that there is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Marchaſitical or Vitriolate Matter in <hi>England,</hi> beſides thoſe Stones, from which the greateſt part of Vitriol is obtain'd, I my ſelf am a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who have obtain'd a Vitriol from a Vein of Metalline Oar, conſiſting of a black, heavy Stuff, without any troubleſome or artificial Preparation.</p>

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:59609:443"/>ſome noxious and contagious ſubterraneal <hi>Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> are the following.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. Becauſe frequently the Cauſes are not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt; and</item>

                           <item>4. As the <hi>Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi> are Saline, Sulphureous, Antimonial, Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical, or of another Nature, they may have dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Effects; ſo in <hi>Hungary,</hi> ſome cauſe a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of breathing.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>But the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of the Earth, do not only affect the Body by the Mediation of Reſpiration, but being contiguous to the Skin, get in at the Pores of the Body, and have ſenſible Effects on the Internal Parts. And that the Pores of the Body are capable of receiving very ſubtle <hi>Effluvia,</hi> might be evinc'd by ſeveral Inſtances; but it may ſuffice to intimate, that I have ſo prepar'd a Mineral Subſtance, that it would have very ſenſible Effects on Subſtances contain'd in the Bladders of dead Animals, when it had no other way to get to thoſe Subſtances than through the Pores of the Bladder, which are not near ſo perſpirable as other Parts of the Body, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted to hold ſo ſubtle and penetrating a LI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor as Urine.</p>
                        <p>Nor need it be a leſs Wonder, how theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneal <hi>Effluvia</hi> ſhould have ſo ſudden Effects on human Bodies, and in ſo little time, ſince we ſee in moiſt Weather, how ſuddenly Lute-ſtrings are broke, and Ropes ſhorten'd by the Inſinuation of moiſt Particles into their Pores. And tho' thoſe <hi>Effluvia</hi> are not ſo plentifully diſpers'd in the Air, as to enter the Pores in ſuch Swarms,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:59609:443"/>yet the Maſs of Humors may in time be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently impregnated with thoſe noxious Vapours to enable them to produce their Effects, when, ſuck'd into the Capillary Veſſels, they gradually deprave the Maſs of Blood.</p>
                        <p>And that <hi>Effluvia</hi> from without, may have conſiderable Effects on the Maſs of Blood, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from <hi>Appenſa</hi> and <hi>Periapta,</hi> as alſo the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Mercurial Plaiſters and Girdles; and the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of a Load-ſtone, which caus'd a Friend of mine to be troubled with Fits of the Colick, an Argument that Mineral <hi>Effluvia</hi> may cauſe particular Diſeaſes. To which we may add, that Arſenical <hi>Appenſa,</hi> extoll'd by ſome in the Plague, have produc'd the Effects of Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and in ſome a Faintneſs and Diſpiritedneſs, according to the Teſtimony of ſeveral Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. And that Mineral Expirations may cauſe a determinate Diſtemper, we may learn from an Obſervation of mine, which was, That a Chymiſt rubbing very often Red Arſnick in a Mortar, and endeavouring to make an Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Medicine of it, firſt complain'd to me of a Difficulty of breathing, and ſometimes of Pains and Tumors in his Teſticles.</p>
                        <p>And it will not be very much doubted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mineral <hi>Effluvia</hi> penetrate the Pores of the Body or not, by thoſe that ſhall know, that the Fumes of Sulphur are ſo penetrating, that at the <hi>Pic</hi> of <hi>Teneriff,</hi> they blacken Silver in the Pockets of thoſe that go up to it. I made a Preparation of Sulphur, which emitted <hi>Effluvia</hi> ſo powerful in the Cold, that they penetrated a Leathern Purſe, and diſcoloured Silver con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in it.</p>
                        <pb n="282" facs="tcp:59609:444"/>
                        <p>But beſides the forementioned Effects of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours on the <hi>Pic</hi> of <hi>Teneriff,</hi> I was told that one that aſcended that Mountain, had the Colour of his Hair altered before he came down again; which argues the Power of Mineral <hi>Effluvia</hi> to penetrate the Pores of the Body.</p>
                        <p>But leſt it ſhould be queſtioned by ſome, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch Mineral <hi>Effluvia</hi> would not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, and ceaſe in leſs time than Endemical Diſeaſes are continued in one Place; I ſhall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate that I think ſeveral ſubterraneal Bodies may have a power of propagating their Virtue to Matter contiguous to them, by ſome Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Principle, or ſomething Analogous to a Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or by bringing ſome more Crude Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Earths gradually and ſucceſſively to a greater Degree of Maturity and Perfection: For it hath been obſerved, that in Tract of time a Mineral might be obtained from an Earth which at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time it could not be obtain'd from; which Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation holds as to Nitre, which is one of the moſt Catholick Foſſils, and moſt plentifully emits <hi>Effluvia.</hi> Beſides, tho' Mineral <hi>Effluvia</hi> in the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the, Earth diſcoverable by us, ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd; I ſee not why ſupplies may not be brought from the Bowels of the Earth. Indeed, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how cloſely the Matter of Minerals is crowded together, and how long Magnets ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from their Mines, emit <hi>Effluvia</hi> without a ſenſible Diminution, the Stock of Mineral Earth from whence they flow cannot be thought ſuddenly to be exhauſted; for an Effluviating power is ſo durable, that one had a perfumed Watch, which, tho' conſtantly worn, preſerv'd it's Scent 16 years, and by the ſame Reaſon could
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:59609:444"/>perfume Marbles quite through, ſo that they retain'd their Scent a long time.</p>
                        <p>But before I leave this ſecond Propoſition, it is requiſite that I ſhould take Notice, that noxious <hi>Effluvia</hi> may cauſe Diſtempers, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Reſpiration and penetrating the Pores of our Body, but by impregnating the Water made uſe of for preparing and Diluting our Aliment, without any ſenſible alteration in the Water to be diſcern'd by us; So Water by an Infuſion of <hi>Crocus Metallorum</hi> becomes Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick; and indeed ſometimes, thoſe <hi>Effluvia</hi> are ſo numerous, that in the Borders of <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> the Mud in a Ditch is ſo ſtrongly impregnated with ſubterraneal Exhalations, that at the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Earth or Water they will take fire, and flame like a Candle.</p>
                        <p>But beſides that Diſtempers may be propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by theſe ſubtle <hi>Effluvia</hi> impregnating Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they may be alſo prejudicial, in as much as being mixed with the Nutriment of Plants, they may deprave their Juices, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make them unfit to be eaten: And that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Effluvia</hi> may in a great meaſure deprave and influence the ſubſtances of Plants in their growth, is confirmed by ſome, who have noted, that Oaks, growing in Ground which abounded with Vitriolate Mines, were much more heavy and ſolid than others; and theſe <hi>Effluvia</hi> are ſometimes ſo numerous and crouded into the Pores of Plants, as not to be overcome and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted by the Ferments of the Plants, but to keep their own Natures; for I have obſerved in a Vine near <hi>Paris</hi> ſeveral Marchaſitical Particles throughout the Pores of the Root and Trunk.
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:59609:445"/>And I have been told that at <hi>Tockay</hi> in <hi>Hungary</hi> the very Kernels of the Grapes are as if it were Guilt over with Leaf Gold. But,</p>
                        <p>Beſides the aforementioned Ways by which our Bodies may be affected with Noxious <hi>Effluviums,</hi> we may not a little ſuffer, by the deprav'd Humours which ſome Animals we Feed upon, are nouriſhed by, and which viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate their Bodies primarily, and ſecondarily ours.</p>
                        <p>As from what hath been ſaid it, appears, that Subterraneal <hi>Effluvia</hi> may cauſe Diſtempers, ſo it may not be amiſs to take Notice that poſſibly in ſome meaſure Mineral <hi>Effluvia</hi> may prevent Diſtempers; for 'tis Obſerved, that ſeveral parts of <hi>Scotland</hi> are free from Agues, and that very hot and large Regions in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> are rarely troubl'd with the Plague; nor is it leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable that in <hi>Ireland</hi> the Air is impregnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch ſort of Emanations as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Generation of any venemous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; To which I ſhall add the following In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from <hi>Beguinus</hi> in his own words, who ſays, <hi>Dignum admiratione eſt, quod quamvis in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinia Hydriae Comitatus Gloricenſis, ubi reperitur co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pioſè ☿ ſingulis fere annis Lues peſtifera graſſatur, illa tamen ſemper immunis ab hac manere ſoleat, id<expan>

                           </note> that divers Epidemical Diſeaſes are in great Part produc'd by Subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal <hi>Effluvia.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THo' ſeveral Epidemical Diſtempers are cauſed by manifeſt alterations in ſenſible Qualities of the Air; yet to ſhew that ſome of them principally, and others partly depend on the Effects of Subterraneal <hi>Effluvia,</hi> I ſhall offer the following Conſiderations.</p>
                        <p>And Firſt, the Structure and diſpoſition of the Parts of our Globe, which are not much below the Surface of it, and much more, the deeper Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneal Regions, are ſo plentifully ſtocked with Mineral ſubſtances; ſo, that it is not improbable but that Subterraneal <hi>Effluvia</hi> aſcending thence into the Air, may cauſe exceſſive Heat or Cold, or ſome other manifeſt Qualities, and conſequently in part occaſion moſt Epidemical Diſeaſes. For from what I have elſewhere ſhewn, it not only appears, that theſe <hi>Effluvia,</hi> by acting on one another may excite ſudden heats; but alſo that Minerals, of different Degrees of Maturity, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on one another, may produce an Intenſe Cold. Beſides, the changes of the Air on which Epidemical Diſeaſes depend, are ſo conſiderable, and inſtantaneous, that they can ſcarce be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Influence of the Sun or Moon, which are too regular and conſtant in their Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to cauſe ſuch Anomalous effects, as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but take Notice of in a few years time; but
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:59609:446"/>are rather cauſed by an irruption of Subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal Steams, which are frequently both impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and irregular: And tho' ſome attribute them to the Influence of the Stars; yet the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Judiciary Aſtrology having been ſo plainly detected by ſeveral Learned Men, I ſhall here only obſerve that it is much more unlikely that particular Towns ſhould alone be Influenced by ſuch, than by <hi>Effluviums</hi> from Bodies near the Surface of the Earth where thoſe Places ſtand; and that which renders it much more probable is, that I have frequently known Diſeaſes very Fatal to happen ſuddenly in ſome places, where the firſt Contagion hath been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a very troubleſome Fog.</p>
                        <p>That ſudden and violent Heats may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by a Mixture of Subterraneal Bodies, not only appears from Oil of Vitrol pour'd upon Iron, Spirit of Nitre upon Butter of Antimony, Filings of Copper, Tin, or crude Antimony; But from Oil of Vitriol poured upon Powdered Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſites which was accompanied with very ſtrong Scented Fumes: To which I ſhall add, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Sulphur hath to my knowledge had conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable effects on Marchaſites: And I have been told by a <hi>German</hi> Chymiſt, that in <hi>Germany,</hi> Marchaſites which were found there, would grow hot, if long immers'd in pure Water. And if we conſider upon how many Accidents the Courſe of Subterraneal Waters may be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it will be eaſily evident, upon that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count conſiderable Degrees of Heat may ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; for if a convenient quantity of Filings of Steel be mixed with Powder of Sulphur, and that Mixture be moiſtened with Water, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:59609:446"/>grows very hot, and emits Fumes copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, like Slak'd-Lime.</p>
                        <p>And I have been inform'd by ſeveral, who fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Mines, that Damps, which are made up of Subterraneal <hi>Effluviums,</hi> are not only very irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular in Reference to their Diſtance, but alſo their Duration; and have very ill effects on thoſe that come within the reach of them; and if ſuch pernicious Fumes are to be diſcover'd ſo near the Surface of the Earth, well may they affect thoſe that Inhabit on the Soil, near which ſuch <hi>Effluvia</hi> riſe: I ſay <hi>near which,</hi> becauſe tho' they do not immediately riſe in the very Towns they infect, and are carried thither by the Motion of the Air; yet in a large Tract of Land, they may be ſo diſperſed as to have no conſiderable Effects.</p>
                        <p>But it is not requiſite always that thoſe <hi>Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> which cauſe Diſtempers, ſhould be noxious at their firſt Riſe from the Earth, ſince Mineral Fumes may acquire new Qualities by aſſociat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with particular Particles in the Air, and may by that means be diſpoſed to act upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Parts of the Body, and to cauſe a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Diſeaſe: So tho' neither Spirit of Nitre nor Sal Armoniack alone can Diſſolve Gold; yet <hi>Aq. Regia</hi> which is a Compoſition of both, will; but hath no ſuch effect on Silver, Diamond's or Rubies.</p>
                        <p>As for the Reaſon why Epidemick Diſtempers affect ſome and let others go free; it may not only be accounted for by the peculiar Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe Bodies, but alſo by conſidering, that the <hi>Effluvia</hi> which riſe from the Earth, may be
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:59609:447"/>ſo imperfectly mixed with the Air, as to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one Body, and not another; ſo I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſeveral Leaves on a Tree blaſted with a Wind which blew at that Corner of the Ground, yet others on the ſame piece of Ground were untouch'd; nay, the very Leaves of that were not all blaſted on that ſide which the Wind blew, ſo that I ſuſpected ſome Arſenical Vapours being mixed with the Air, caſt upon them were like Hail ſhot from a Gun, and ſcattered in it's Flight: And on a Cauſe not much unlike this may depend the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of ſome Winds which cauſe Blaſts on the Faces of ſome People, yet let others go free, as I remember I was Riding once in the Wind, which, tho' it diſaffected not me, yet my Man, who Rid after me, ſcaped it not.</p>
                        <p>In favour of our Hypotheſis already laid down, I ſhall add, that the ſhort duration of ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers, as well as their Progreſſive Motion from one Town to another, are Arguments either that theſe Vapours riſe all at once, and are diſperſed, or the Subterraneal Commotion that cauſes them paſſes on from one Part of the Earth ſubjacent, to another. Nor is it leſs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to our Hypotheſis that the ſhort durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome Diſtempers may depend on a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive riſe of <hi>Effluvia,</hi> ſince when thoſe of one kind ceaſe to be emitted, and another kind ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, the latter may check the former by preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitating them, or uniting into <hi>Quid Tertium</hi> leſs prejudicial to all Animal Bodies. So by an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cociation of new Particles with thoſe Peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial <hi>Effluvia</hi> which cauſe an Annual Plague in <hi>Grand Cairo,</hi> it ſuddenly ſtops, and thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready infected, dye not, if the Air be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:59609:447"/>impregnated before, as a late Writer of Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages into <hi>Aegypt</hi> teſtifies in theſe Words. <hi>The Drops or Dew purifies the Air; for as ſoon as it falls, the Plague ceaſes to be Mortal, none dyes of it; The Air is wholeſome, all Diſtempers ceaſe; and if any perſon grows ſick, he never dyes,</hi> &amp;c. I have been told that about the <hi>Tin Mines</hi> in <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> not only the Graſs and Fern, but the Trees will be ſuddenly blaſted, by the powerful <hi>Effluvia</hi> which ſuddenly riſe over a conſiderable compaſs of Ground.</p>
                        <p>Having ſaid thus much of <hi>Epidemical</hi> Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, it perhaps may be Expected that I ſhould ſay ſomething of the Plague and it's Origin, which I muſt own my ſelf at a loſs in; for tho' I think it rather ſeemingly Pious, than really ſo, to aſcribe ſuch things to a Supernatural Power, which may be accounted for by Natural ones; yet I deny not but that ſome may ariſe from a Supernatural Origin.</p>
                        <p>But what ever may be the firſt Origin of Plagues, I am inclined to think, that the Propagation of them depends on a Malignant Diſpoſition in the Air, ariſing from ſome Subterraneal <hi>Effluvia;</hi> for theſe Reaſons; Firſt, becauſe the Malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Aſpects of the Planets ſeem too Remote and Indeterminate to act on a particular place. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, according to the vulgar Hypotheſes, the Plague ought to rage moſt where it very ſeldom happens: For <hi>Leo Africanus</hi> informs us, that in <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midia,</hi> tho' raging hot, it happens but once in an hundred Years; and <hi>Purchas</hi> in his <hi>Pilgrimage,</hi> Lib. 6. Cap. 13. tells us, it is not known at all in the Land of <hi>Negro,</hi> and ſeldom in <hi>Japan</hi> or <hi>New-England;</hi> and in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies, China, Tunquin,</hi>

                        <p>But perhaps it may be ſaid, that theſe Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as much Preſs our Hypotheſis, as thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers alledged by Phyſitians: But if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that I confeſs it difficult to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Original cauſe, the other part of my Hypotheſis is not at all ſhaken, ſince it could not be denyed, but that noxious <hi>Effluvia</hi> would be able to propagate the Plague there, were there an Original cauſe to ſet thoſe ſecondary cauſes on work: But for as much as from our Hypotheſis it appears that the Original Cauſe of the Plague is not always ſo abſtruſe, but ſometimes begun, as well as propagated by thoſe noxious <hi>Effluvia,</hi> without the Concurrence of any other Cauſe, it may be requiſite to take Notice; that in <hi>China</hi> and thoſe Countries where the Plague, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, we may preſume ſuch noxious Steams are not emitted; for tho' Sulphur is uſually found in many Countries where Metalline Veins are frequent; yet I never heard that in thoſe Mines an Ounce of Native Sulphur was ever found.</p>
                        <p>Beſides, tho' there may be Minerals in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try which may emit noxious Vapours; yet the Mines from whence they come may by ſo deep in the Earth that they may not be able to infect the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> powerfully enough to cauſe a Peſtilence, tho' promoted in making their Way
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:59609:448"/>by ſome violent Earth-quake, when upon a fall of ſome weighty Maſs of Earth in Subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal Caverns a trembling Motion is communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Earth about it, and propagated more or leſs proportionable to the firſt Cauſe; for which Reaſons, noxious <hi>Effluvia</hi> being ſometimes emitted which could not otherwiſe make their own way, probably the Plague happens in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi> once in 30 or 100 Years periodically. And a <hi>French</hi> Hiſtorian takes notice of a Diſeaſe in <hi>France,</hi> not much unlike the Colick, which, for a long time return'd every 10th Year. And <hi>Platerus,</hi> Lib. 2. <hi>P. M.</hi> 303. Relates that the Plague at <hi>Braſil</hi> ſucceſſively return'd every 10 Years, for 70 Years together.</p>
                        <p>But further, tho' in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> ſuch Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours ſhould ariſe, which would of themſelves be pernicious; yet others may riſe, which tho' noxious likewiſe, may by combining with them, form a Third Subſtance innocent enough: So Corroſive Sublimate, when combined with Crude Mercury, becomes ſo uſeful and innocent a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine as <hi>Mercurius Dulcis.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Beſides what hath been ſaid, another Reaſon why ſome Countries are free from the Plague, may be ſome peculiar diſpoſition in the Air to reſiſt the Effects of noxious Exhalations; as when the River <hi>Nile</hi> Increaſes and Over-flows, the Plague in <hi>Aegypt</hi> ceaſes: And the Soil in ſome Countries is of ſuch a Temper as to impregnate the Air, ſo that it ſuffers not poyſonous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to live in it,</p>
                        <p>A Second Reaſon why I think the Plague is propagated by Subterraneal <hi>Effluvia,</hi> is, becauſe it happens ſometimes when no Diſtemper is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:59609:449"/>in the Air which ſeems able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch an Effect; yet when the Aſpects of the Stars have been threatning enough, and the Air very intemperate, no Plague hath follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as when <hi>Fernelius</hi> Writ his Obſervations <hi>De abditis rerum Cauſis,</hi> Lib. 2. Chap. 13. It was immoderately hot, but very Healthful; and the ſame further tells us, that the Plague hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times began in Winter, and gone off in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: And <hi>Johannes Morellus,</hi> that a Temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and Healthful Spring, which ſucceeded a Winter, in which the <hi>North</hi>-wind Reign'd, brought in the Plague, tho' at the ſame time, the <hi>North</hi>-wind continued ſerene and clear. And the Conſtitution of the Air before the Plague in 1665, was not much unlike it. Whence it is evident, that the Plague depends not on manifeſt Qualities of the Air, but is rather cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Subterraneal <hi>Effluvia</hi> which float in it, and which are drawn in by Reſpiration; and that Poiſonous Exhalations have roſe from the Earth and infected the Air with a Peſtilential Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Monſieur <hi>de Meſzeray</hi> in the Life of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip de Valoris,</hi> and <hi>Diemerbroeck de Peſte,</hi> Lib. 1.

                     <p>For from what is elſewhere deliver'd, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that there are various Effluvia, beſides thoſe that afforded ordinary Meteors, which ariſe from Bodies in ſubterraneal Parts; ſeveral of which have no Names, or at leaſt none aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd them, and have ſeveral Powers and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities which we know not of.</p>
                     <pb n="300" facs="tcp:59609:453"/>
                     <p>Beſides, the Sun and Planets may have In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences here below, diſtinct from their Heat and Light, which may mix with the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> we live in: And for as much as thoſe celeſtial Globes that move about us, may be endew'd with ſubſtances, that we here know nothing of, the Effluviums which come from them, may affect us in a different manner from any Bodies, we here have in our <hi>Atmoſphere.</hi> And tho the greateſt Part of thoſe Effluviums,<note place="margin">Qualities in the Air which ariſe from the Union and Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of other Bodies with it.</note> which are active in our <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> ariſe from ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneal Parts, and from Celeſtial Bodies; yet doubtleſs there are a great many that reſult from the mutual Action of the different Parts of it acting on thoſe Bodies that are expos'd to it; for tho', notwithſtanding any manifeſt Qualities we can diſcern in it, the Air ſeems to be unfit for a Menſtruum; yet I doubt not, but it may have conſiderable Effects on Bodies diſpos'd to be acted on by it; for not to urge, that ſometimes the Quantity of a Menſtruum compenſates it's want of ſtrength; we know, that there are ſeveral Liquors, which, tho inſipid, and make no ſenſible Impreſſions, on the Organs of Taſte, yet by their various Attritions and frequent Motions againſt Bodies, become fit for <hi>Solvents:</hi> So the Air, having it's Parts always acting on Copper expos'd to it, in tract of time, produces that Effloreſcence colour'd like Verdigreaſe; a factitious Body uſually produc'd from the ſame Subſtance corroded by Vinegar or the Juice of the Husks of Grapes. Beſides, we ſee, that Mercury, which hath no ſenſible Taſte, hath a faculty of Diſſolving Gold and Silver, and all Strong Menſtruums, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:59609:453"/>Bodies with the utmoſt Vigour, are ſoon glutted, and can diſſolve no more; ſo that, tho' the Air be a weak one, yet it hath this laſting Advantage, that when a ſmall Quantity of it is glutted, it bears ſo great a Proportion to the Body it acts on, that a freſh Part of it is ſtill to ſupply the Deficiency and Place of that which can act no longer.</p>

                     <p>Moreover, tho' the Parts of Air are very minute, yet, we know, that the Bodies which are expos'd to their Action, are only acted on by them upon their outward Superficies, which may conſiſt of as many Parts, and as minute as thoſe of the Air, which, by ſucceſſively hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt them, carry them along with them: So Sugar or <hi>Sal Gem.</hi> being immers'd in Water, have their Parts diſſolv'd and carri'd up into the Liquor, by the ſucceſſive attritions and occurſions of ſo inſipid a Menſtruum, and whoſe Parts are in ſo gentle a Motion.</p>

                     <p>And firſt, I ſhall urge the appearing growth of ſome Salts, in Bodies, which uſually afforded them not at all, or not in ſuch plenty; Vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Effloreſcences having been obſerv'd to be, after ſometime, on the gliſtering parts of Marcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, which were kept in a dry Room: And it hath been obſerv'd, that a heavy ponderous Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral expos'd to the Air for ſome time, became ſo brittle, that it would crimble away, and plentifully abounded with Copperas; and ſome of the ſame being kept in a cloſe and dry Place, was in ſome time covered over with an Efflore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence, which being mix'd with an Infuſion of Galls, manifeſted it ſelf to be a Vitriol; whoſe growth is the more ſtrange in the Air, becauſe it is not a meer Acid Salt; but abounds with combuſtible and ſulphureous Parts, which I have often ſeparated from common Vitriol without the addition of any combuſtible Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and ſometimes without any addition at all. And it was not a little ſtrange that our blackiſh Minerals, yielded vitriol Effloreſcences ſo ſoon, ſince I kept ſhining Marchaſites, from whence
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:59609:454"/>they uſually prepare Vitriol, without being changed near ſo much, as thoſe I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd; and it is uſual, ſometimes, to let them lie expos'd to the Air two Years, before they yield their vitriolate Parts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Alum Ore regains it's Salt when expos'd to the Air.</note>To theſe Obſervations we may add, that Alum Ore, being robb'd of it's Salt, recovers it again by being expos'd to the Air; and Lime in old Walls hath in time regain'd a Nitrous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which I have learn'd by diſſolving it in common Water, and evaporating the filtrated Solution. Nay,<note place="margin">And ſo does Vitriol.</note> calcin'd Vitriol expos'd to the Air, in a competent time regains freſh Parts of a vitriolate Salt.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Suſpicions about the Productions of Vitriol.</note>But tho I propoſe theſe Obſervations as favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the Suſpicions laid down; yet I am apt to ſuſpect, that the Air concurs to the Production of them, rather as an Ingredient, than as an Agent; or that the Production of them depends on ſome ſeminal Principle, by which, when they are once ripen'd, the Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of the Air helps them to diſcloſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Form of ſaline Concretes; as in Tartarous Matter ſaline Parts are generated, which cauſe that acid Taſte in Tartar, of <hi>Reniſh</hi> Wine eſpecially: Beſides, it may be ſuſpected, that the <hi>Salt</hi> found in Marchaſites, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be made of ſaline Particles ſwimming in the Air, and attracted by congenerous Particles, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in thoſe Bodies, that are, as it were, the Wombs of ſuch Minerals; or that theſe Aerial Salts, aſſiſted by the Moiſture of the Air, open the Textures of theſe Wombs, and by extricating the latent ſaline Parts, and adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, compoſe thoſe emergent Bodies;
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:59609:455"/>but tho I ſuſpect, that the Air is not wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in producing ſuch Bodies, yet I believe it is in a great meaſure concern'd, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready intimated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The neceſſity of Air to continue flame, an Argument of a latent Principle.</note>But to proceed to other Inſtances of theſe Aerial latent Qualities, I think that the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the Air's Preſence to preſerve and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue Flame, is a ſufficient Argument of ſome latent Spirit or Quality, whether vital Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or nitrous Spirit diffus'd through the Air, on which likewiſe the Life of Animals depends, and without which, they, as well as Flame, preſently, are extinguiſh'd and die.</p>
                     <p>To theſe I ſhall add, that Animal Subſtances enclos'd in <hi>Vacuo,</hi> yield not Inſects, as when ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the open Air; And it is related by a Noble Man of this Country, that an Oak being dug out of a Rock of Salt, was ſo hard, that Iron Tools could ſcarce work upon it; yet in three or four Days, being expos'd to the Air, it was rotten. And it hath been obſerv'd by ſeveral, that the Air hath ſuch an Influence on Diaphoretick Antimony, that if it be long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to it, it becomes <hi>Emetick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From which Obſervations, and what I have before laid down concerning Quick-Lime, the Air ſeems to be a Subſtance capable of being aſſimilated by every Body,<note place="margin">The Air ſeems to conſiſt of all ſorts of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</note> or that it conſiſts of all ſorts of ſeminal Corpuſcles; ſo that any Body may find a Subſtance there, analogous to it, and fit to make up a part of the ſame Body.</p>
                     <p>But without any further notice of this odd Surmiſe, I ſhall ſubjoyn the following <hi>Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> to favour my Suſpicion. The firſt is, That
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:59609:455"/>tho' the Juice of the Fruit of the Tree <hi>Junipa</hi> (which the <hi>Indians</hi> uſe to black their Faces, to make them more formidable to their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies) gives ſuch a Tincture, that it cannot be waſh'd out with Soap; yet the Air abounds with Particles of ſuch a Nature, that it diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in ten Days time; tho' I ſuſpect that, it in a great meaſure depends on the continual Excretion of Sweat, through the Pores of the Skin.</p>

                     <list>
                        <item>1. Whether thoſe Effects, which are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thought to depend on the immediate Wrath of God, and the Intercourſe of Angels, may not ariſe from theſe Steams, whoſe Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are probably heteroclite, and unknown; ſince we ſee that there are ſeveral Steams di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers'd through the <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> which cauſe it to raiſe Mercury in a Baroſcope, which could be no otherwiſe diſcover'd, but by the Effects they have on the Air, made evident by that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument. And this Conſideration hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times made me ſuſpect, that even the Sun-Beams may cauſe a manifeſt Gravity in the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> beſides that which they do by virtue of their Heat; and it may be worth Enquiry, whether ſome Spots in the Sun, upon their Diſſolution, may not be diſpers'd through, and cauſe ſome conſiderable Effects in our <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> at leaſt in it's Gravity.</item>
                        <item>2. It will not ſeem improbable, that ſome Bodies have peculiar Diſpoſitions to be aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with thoſe Exotick Principles, which ariſe from ſubterraneal Parts, or are tranſmitted from the Planets. Upon which Diſpoſitions, or the contrary, what we call Sympathy and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy depend. By Virtue of ſuch Diſpoſitions, a Burning-Glaſs refracts the Sun-Beams, and the Sun-Beams impart a Lucidneſs to the <hi>Bolonian</hi>

                        <item>3. The third thing which may be ſuggeſted by what we have deliver'd; is, whether there may not be <hi>Receptacles</hi> or <hi>Attractives</hi> of Syde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial and other Exotick <hi>Effluviums,</hi> that wander up and down the Air, ſuch as are Magnets; by which I mean, not ſuch a Body that can attract foreign <hi>Effluvia;</hi> but ſuch a one as can detain them, when by virtue of their various Motions they happen to come near ſuch a Magnet.

                     </list>
                     <p>But a greater reſemblance of the Magnet may be allow'd to ſome Bodies, than what is here mention'd; for ſuch a Magnet may not only by a Juxta-Poſition or Contact detain the <hi>Effluviums,</hi> that would glide along it; but alſo arreſt thoſe ſubtle Parts of Matter by a kind of precipitating Quality; and ſo it may fetch in ſome <hi>Effluvia,</hi> which would otherwiſe paſs by it: On which occaſion, I remember, that in ſome Caſes, I have been able to give ſome Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Electrical Qualities, without exciting them by rubbing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>Nor will it be loſt Labour to expoſe ſeveral Mineral and other Subſtances to the Air, and to enquire, what it is that gives them the additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Weight, they receive by it; and with what Qualities that Subſtance is endew'd; for if ſuch Experiments could be try'd with good Magnets at ſeveral times, and in ſeveral places, we might by them learn, what <hi>Effluviums</hi> the Air, then, and in thoſe places, abounded with; nor might it be of ſmall Importance in diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a correſpondency betwixt the Terreſtrial and ſome Etherial Globes of the World.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt other things which make me hope that Equiries of this Nature may not be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unſucceſsful; I ſhall only intimate, that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Operation the Air hath upon Vitriol, diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſified by circumſtances, after Fire could work no further on it: For <hi>Zwelſer</hi> ſpeaking of a Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Preparation of Vitrol, <hi>Viz.

                        <pb n="313" facs="tcp:59609:460"/>and at the laſt, when it had been kept a long time, a pretty quantity of true running Mercury.</p>
                     <p>Beſides what hath been already ſaid, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Colcothar,</hi> I ſhall propoſe two or three In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, to any Virtuoſo, that would aſſiſt in theſe Tryals.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, it will be convenient to note, the Nature of the Soil; the Temperature of the Air; the Month of the Year; the Winds; the weight of the <hi>Atmoſphere;</hi> and, if any, the Spots of the Sun; the Moon's Age, and her place in the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> as well as the principal Aſpects of the Stars and Planets; ſince we cannot deny, tho' not poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively aſſert, that theſe Bodies are concern'd in the production of thoſe Salts which <hi>Colcothar</hi> yields: This, nevertheleſs we know, that, tho' thoſe Bodies which move about us, ſhould have no conſiderable effect on what is done in our <hi>Atmoſphere;</hi> yet it, at different times and Places, abounds with various ſubterraneal Steams, and ſeveral <hi>Phaenomena</hi> appear in it, which are irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, and tho' ſome are regular enough, yet are they as to their Cauſes unknown, as thoſe <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae Piperinae</hi> in <hi>Germany;</hi> which begin and ceaſe to flow at certain times: And <hi>Johannes de Laet</hi> tells us, that in the <hi>Mexican</hi> Province, <hi>Xilolepec,</hi> there is a Fountain, which ſucceſſively flows and ceaſes to flow for four Years together; and in the time of it's flowing, it's obſerv'd, that it flows much more plentifully in dry, than Rainy Weather.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly;</hi> I would recommend the following Obſervations, <hi>viz.</hi> What kind of Vitriol the <hi>Colcothar</hi> is made of, <hi>Martial, Hungarian</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Vitriol; what degree of Calcination is made uſe of, and how far the Calcin'd Matter is freed from it's Salt by Water: For I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:59609:461"/>a Saltleſs <hi>Colcother</hi> expos'd to the Air ſeveral Months, without the leaſt increaſe of Weight, which probably might depend on ſome Peculiarity of the Air, where the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment was try'd, ſince in other Places, the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs hath been the contrary.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Thirdly;</hi> Beſides ſeveral ſorts of Vitriols, it may not be amiſs to try theſe Experiments with ſeveral Preparations of them; for I once made a Solution of Copper with Sublimate and Spirit of Salt; which, expos'd to the Air, was green, tho' before, it was not of that Colour, but of a muddy Red; and ſome which, appear'd to be a dirty Liquor, as long as it was kept in the Veſſel it was made in, free from the Air, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to be of the Colour of an Emerald, when expos'd to it. And what was remarkable in theſe Experiments, is, that accordingly as the Qualities of the Matter and Circumſtances dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, the green Colour appear'd ſooner or leſs ſpeedily.</p>
                     <p>But to conclude: Tho' the ſucceſs of Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this kind be very doubtful; yet ſince the Attainments are ſo deſirable, it may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the curious, not to pretermit the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, which may ſucceed ſuch Endeavours: For as Mariners at Sea, who at a diſtance upon the <hi>Horizon,</hi> ſome times ſee ſomething ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure which, whether it be a Cloud, a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, or an Iſland, they cannot diſtinguiſh, yet it hath prov'd worth their while to approach it, and not loſe the probability of a Diſcovery; ſo, who knows, but by making an advance in leſs promiſing Experiments, we may diſcover ſomething which may richly reward our Pains.</p>

North</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> draws other Pieces of Steel to it, and Communicates to them in a faint degree the ſame Attractive and Directive Virtues, which are not ſlight and tranſient Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, but durable and laſting; where it is evident, that, tho' the Steel is endew'd with magnetical Virtues, yet it hath not the Form of a Load-ſtone; but only, the Metal by the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Load-ſtone acquires ſuch a diſpoſition in it's Parts, as inables it to perform Magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Operations; which Power it loſes again, by being heated red hot, and cooled in the Air, yet the Form of the Steel is ſtill the ſame: And from what I have in another place laid down, it appears, that a Load-ſtone it ſelf may loſe it's faculty of attracting Iron, and yet retain all it's other Qualities; Nay, tho' it is a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Quality of a Load-ſtone, to point <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South;</hi> yet without deſtroying it's ſubſtantial Form by Fire, the Poles may very eaſily and

                     <p>But to make it further appear, that Magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Qualities may be Mechanically produc'd, or alter'd; I ſhall add, that I have obſerv'd, that whilſt the Parts of well temper'd Steel have been excited to Motion by Rubbing, they would draw to them Filings of Steel, or thin Fragments of Steel or Iron; but when the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious Warmth acquired by that attrition ceaſes; they preſently loſe their attractive Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: And I have elſewhere obſerv'd, that the lower end of a perpendicular Bar of Iron, hath been ſo far alter'd by the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of the terraqueous Globe, as to be turn'd into a kind of Magnet, whoſe lower end becomes the <hi>North</hi> Pole of it, and the other the <hi>South;</hi> to which Obſervation we may add, that if the Bar of Iron ſtand but a while in an erect Poſture, the Magnetical Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of it will be ſo tranſient, that if the upper End, which attracted the <hi>North</hi> end of a Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, be inverted and held downward, it will drive it away; and on the contrary, if it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a long time in that Poſture, the change wrought upon it is ſo great, that a Piece of a Bar of Iron, which was upon the Top of a Church, call'd <hi>Arimini,</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> by the Ruſtyneſs of it, and the Magnetical Virtues it had acquir'd, ſeem'd to be turn'd into a Load-ſtone.</p>
                     <p>And further, it may be obſerv'd, that if a Piece of Iron, have it's Pores open'd and looſen'd, it imbibes the Magnetical <hi>Effluvia</hi> of the Earth ſo faſt, as to acquire Magnetical Virtues much
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:59609:464"/>ſooner. And here it may not be uſeleſs to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, what different Effects, Fire hath upon two different Bodies; for by keeping a Load-ſtone red hot, it loſes it's attractive Power, tho' afterwards, it be cool'd in a perpendicular Poſture; whereas, Iron, by being heated and cool'd in a perpendicular Poſture, acquires a manifeſt Virticity; ſo that the internal Texture and Conſtitution of the Load-ſtone, ſeem'd to be deſtroy'd and weaken'd by Ignition: From whence likewiſe it appears, that Magnetical Qualities may be altered by, and depend on Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical Principles. And,</p>
                     <p>To theſe Obſervations, I ſhall add further, that having brought a Piece of Oker to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Shape, and after I had heated it red hot, ſuffered it to cool in a convenient Poſture, it was able to exerciſe Magnetical Operations on a poiſed Needle. And indeed, a convenient Poſture, ſo much contributes to the preſervation of Magnetical Qualities, that leaving a very vigorous Load-ſtone, for ſometime, in an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Poſture, it loſt conſiderably of it's Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netical Virtues. And this corruption of Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netical Qualities is further evident in an excited Needle, which, as it is variouſly touch'd with this or that end of a Load-ſtone, points with this or that end <hi>North</hi>-ward or towards the <hi>South.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To make it yet more probable, that Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Virtues may be Mechanically produc'd and deſtroy'd, I ſhall ſubjoyn, that by an Experiment tryed by the Ingeniou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        <note place="margin">Of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical Production of Electri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</note>THO' Electricity be a Quality, generally reckon'd amongſt the Number of thoſe that are term'd occult ones; yet there is no need to aſcribe it to the power of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Form, ſince it may be mechanically pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by material <hi>Effluviums,</hi> iſſuing from, and returning to the Electrical Body, aſſiſted in it's Operation by the External Air.</p>
                     <p>There are ſeveral Modern <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to account for Electricity; as the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Cabeus</hi>'s, who ſuppoſes that, the Steams of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrical Body diſcuſſing and expelling the ambient Air, that, when driven off, is violently oppos'd by the Atmoſpherical Air, and being driven back upon
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:59609:468"/>the Body ſaid to be attracted, forces it up to the electrical Body.</p>
                     <p>Another <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> propos'd by the Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby,</hi> and embrac'd by Dr. <hi>Brown</hi> and ſeveral others; is, that the Electrick Body being rubb'd, emits unctuous Steams, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cool'd by the External Air, ſhrink back, and carry along with them, thoſe light Bodies which lie in their way. Of this Opinion is <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> who ſuppoſes theſe unctuous Steams to croſs each other, and by getting into the Pores of Straws and other attracted Bodies, take faſter hold of them, and when they ſhrink back, draw thoſe Bodies along with them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Carteſius</hi> rejecting theſe Hypotheſes, ſupplants another, which I cannot in few Words lay down; but all the Reaſon he rejects them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe he ſuppoſes Glaſs incapable of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting <hi>Effluvia;</hi> it will be ſufficient to remove that difficulty, to Obſerve, that if two Pieces of Glaſs be rubbed together, they emit odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and ſometimes very Stinking <hi>Effluvia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But without taking any further Notice of what Moderns have laid down about Electricity, ſince they allow it to be performed by Virtue of ſubtle Emanations from the Attracting Body; It may ſuffice, that I proceed to mention ſome <hi>Phenomena,</hi> that make us probably believe it done by Virtue of Mechanical Affections, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Attracting Body, or both.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> it is Obſerved, that moſt, if not all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectrical Bodies, attract not till warm'd; by which heat they are enabled to ſend forth <hi>Eufflvia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="325" facs="tcp:59609:468"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Amber attracts moſt vigorouſly when warmed by rubbing and Chafing; by which Action, the Motion of the <hi>Effluvia,</hi> as well as of it's internal Parts are more agreeably modified, than by the Action of Fire; but if the Parts of the Amber be firſt put into Motion by the Fire, and then Modifi'd by Chafing, it ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er becomes Electrical.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Terſion, as well as Chafing, promotes Electricity, by removing thoſe Bodies, which might choak the Pores of the Amber, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the Efflux of Emanations, by ſticking to the ſurface of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Electrical act not like thoſe more ſubtle Magnetical Steams, ſince the Operation of Electrical <hi>Effluvia,</hi> are obſtructed by the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of a piece of the fineſt Linnen or Sarſnet.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Electrical <hi>Effluvia</hi> act leſs vigorouſly in Thick and Cloudy Weather, eſpecially, if the <hi>South</hi> Wind blows; and on the contrary they act like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe more faintly in the Night than in the Day.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Moſt Electrical Bodies are made of Matter, capable of emitting Odoriferous Steams by Heat and Attrition.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seventhly,</hi> For which Reaſon, Bodies continue their Electrical virtues ſometimes after the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the Commotion in the Parts of the Concrete, cauſed by that attrition, not immediately ceaſing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eighthly,</hi> To make it probable that Electrical <hi>Effluvia</hi> may inſinuate themſelves into the Pores of other Bodies, I ſhall add, that I found them ſubtle enough to attract Spirit of Wine, and alſo the Smoak of an extinguiſhed Wax-taper at a conſiderable diſtance.</p>
                     <pb n="326" facs="tcp:59609:469"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ninthly,</hi> The Electrical Virtue depends not on any Sympathy betwixt the Body Attracting and the Subſtance Attracted; ſince Amber indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently draws to it all Bodies, which are not too groſs, except Fire, by the violent Motion of whoſe parts, the Electrical Emanations are diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated, and the Fire determined another way.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tenthly,</hi> A vigorous and well excited piece of Amber will attract not only the Powder, but leſs minute Fragments of Amber; and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Experiment may give us Reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the Electrical <hi>Effluvia</hi> of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting Body, not only faſten upon the Body to be drawn, but that the Cohereing Particles of the <hi>Effluvia</hi> make up viſcous Strings, which intervening betwixt thoſe two Bodies, when their agitation ceaſes, ſhrink inward, and are contracted; as a highly ſtretch'd Lute-ſtring, when permitted to ſhorten it's Dimenſions: The Experiment was this, <hi>viz.</hi> We ſuſpended a piece of Amber by a Silken-thread, by the help of a piece of Wax, and then rubbing the Edge of it with a Pin-cuſhen covered with Courſe black Stuff, when it was well excited, and brought to ſettle, we obſerv'd, that if the Cuſhen was held near the excited Edges, the <hi>Effluvia</hi> would faſten upon it, ſo that when the Cuſhen was remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Amber would follow it ſeveral times for the ſpace of ten or elven Minutes.</p>

                        <p>To try whether the Air was much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Electricity, I ſuſpended a piece of Amber (which, when excited, would ſtir a poiſed Needle ¼ of an Hour) in a ſmall Receiver, and when the Air was exhauſted, the Amber being let down near a Straw or Feather, attracted it in <hi>Vacuo.</hi>

                        <head>EXPERIMENT <hi>VII.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>TO ſhew that the Attraction of light Bodies, depends on very ſmall circumſtances, I made uſe of a Downy Feather taken off the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of a Fowl, to which when it had been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by an excited piece of Amber, I appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the end of my Finger to it, upon which it ſtuck and left the Amber. The ſame ſucceſs I had, when the Experiment at diſtinct times was tryed with the Tip of a Silver Inſtrument, and Iron Key, and, a piece of black Poliſh'd Marble. We had the like ſucceſs, when the Experiment was tryed at ſeveral diſtant times afterwards. But one thing remarkable was, that if the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber had loſt it's attractive virtue, before my Finger or the other Bodies were applyed, the Feather was not diſpoſed to ſtir, till the Amber was again excited.</p>
                        <p>To conclude theſe Notes, I ſhall advertiſe, that the event of Electrical Experiments is very uncertain, and varied by ſlight Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, ſome of which are altogether over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd, which in ſome Meaſure appears from the above recited Notes.</p>
                        <p>And therefore I ſhall add, that ſometimes it is very hard to know whether a Body be Electri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:59609:471"/>or not; for, tho' <hi>Kircher</hi> denies Chryſtal to have an attractive power; yet I have obſerv'd the contrary. And tho', the induſtrious <hi>Gilbert</hi> denies Electricity to Cornelians and Emeralds, yet all that I have try'd, had ſome Degree of it, except one Cornelian. And indeed Electrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is conſtantly inherent in Diamonds, ſo that it may be one good way to try whether they be Genuine, ſince moſt of them are conſiderably more attractive than common Glaſs. But to conclude, I ſhall add further, that rough Diamonds are Obſerv'd, to have a faculty of attracting much more eminently than Poliſh'd ones; for which no other Reaſon can be conceived, but that the Diamond in Poliſhing, being conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, Heated by the Mill, ſeveral and a great part of it's Electrical <hi>Effluvia</hi> are ſpent and fly away.</p>

                        <p>As for the Structure of theſe Elaſtick Parts, they may be conceiv'd different as Mens contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances deviſe to anſwer Particular <hi>Phaenomena:</hi> One may think them like the Spring of a Watch; others like a Fleece of compreſs'd Wool, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring always to expand themſelves; others, like Curl'd pieces of Wire, of different Lengths and Thickneſs, and diverſified by being more or leſs Curl'd: All of which may be capable of being compreſſed and expanded again, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their Native Structure, Heat, Girations and other Motions. I have likewiſe compar'd 'em to thin ſhavings of Wood, which are of different Sizes; and this compariſon may in ſome Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:59609:472"/>Illuſtrate their Generation, there being no Art requiſite to the production of ſuch, nor curious Inſtruments; and yet their Curls are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different and ſeemingly Caſual; as alſo their ſpringneſs depends on their convenient ſhape.

                           <note place="margin">Of the Salts in the Air.</note>THO' the Peripateticks teach, that the Air is an Element, and conſequently a pure ſimple Body, whoſe Qualities are moiſt and dry; yet from what we have already deliver'd, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that it is an Aggregate of various kind of <hi>Effluvia</hi> jumbled and mix'd together; I mean, the Air diſtinct from that Purer Subſtance <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> which I ſuppoſe diffus'd through the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſtellar Part of the Univerſe.</p>
                        <p>Amongſt the <hi>Effluvia</hi> which rove up and down the Air; I account Saline ones the Chief, which is not unlikely, ſince the Terraqueous Globe, which continually emits <hi>Effluvia,</hi> abounds with great Quantities of Marine, Aluminous and Vitriolate Salts, which impregnate the Air; beſides ſeveral Exhalations rais'd by the Sun-Beams, from the Surface of the Earth and Water; not to mention ſeveral other Saline Vapours which are diſperſed in the <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> and ariſe from <hi>Vulcanos,</hi> as well as common Fires.</p>
                        <pb n="346" facs="tcp:59609:481"/>
                        <p>And as it is not improbable, but that the Air plentifully abounds with Saline <hi>Effluvia;</hi> ſo very likely, beſides Nitrous, there are other kinds raiſed up and roving about in it; as Common Salt, and Vitriolate Salts; and that which ſeems to prove, that the Air in ſome places abounds with vitriolate Salts, is, that it hath been obſerv'd, that Hinges have been corroded and rotted, and other things prejudic'd upon a Vitriolate Soil, whereas in Houſes, which ſtood on a <hi>Chalky</hi> Soil, no ſuch Effects were obſerv'd: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, on the Vitriolate Ground, we took No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Saline and White Effloreſcences upon the Surface of the Soil, when beaten upon by the Sun-beams.</p>
                        <p>Beſides which kinds of Salt, I am induc'd to believe, that the Air abounds with Volatile ones; For beſides, that an Acquaintaince of Mine obtained a Spirit and Salt of Similar Qualities with Spirit of <hi>Harts-horn</hi> from Earth dug up ſome Yards deep; we may obſerve in favour of what I propoſe, that the very Soot which riſes from fires near great Towns, a great part of which is diſperſed in the Air, abounds with a Saline Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which may be obtain'd from it by Diſtillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as likewiſe, a great quantity of Volatile Matter may be raiſed in the form of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours from Animal ſubſtances putrified and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</p>
                        <p>But beſides theſe more ſimple Salts, there may be ſeveral others compounded in the Air, which may reſult from ſeveral Coalitions of ſimple Salts; and ſeveral Compound Salts may, not unlikely, ariſe from Subterraneal Parts: In favour of which I ſhall add, that in
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:59609:481"/>
                           <hi>America</hi> the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of a <hi>Vulcano,</hi> not only of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, the Faces of ſome that approach'd too near, but cauſed a manifeſt alteration in the Colour of their Hair. And it hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd that ſeveral Sulphureous Exhalations have been gathered about the Crannies of <hi>Mount Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuvius,</hi> which iſſuing out of ſmall Crannies ſtick to the Edges like Flower of Brimſtone: To which I ſhall add, that I had a Stone brought me from another <hi>Vulcano,</hi> whoſe Pores were full of a White Salt compounded of a fixed one, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Volatile much like <hi>Sal-Armon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Salts we have hitherto taken Notice of, are ſuch as may be referred to a determinate Species: But I am apt to believe, that there are others which are ſuch as are not known, nor have they any Names given them; this appears from what we have elſewhere taught of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneal Fumes; and may be further illuſtrated, by intimating, that I have obſerv'd Old Glaſs-windows ſometimes corroded, as if Worm-eaten; which probably proceeded from ſome corroſive Particles carried thither by the Wind.</p>
                        <p>As for the Nature of theſe ſeveral Salts, that at different times, and in various Places, impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the Air, amongſt the different Methods that might be taken to inveſtigate them, I ſhall mention the following.</p>

In
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:59609:482"/>places where we think Vitriol abounds we may expoſe Preparations of Sulphur, which it uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turns Black: In other Places we may ſpread White Linnen Cloths, and obſerve what Salts they imbibe along with the Riſing Vapours and Falling Dew.</item>
                           <item>A Second way to diſcover the Nature of the Salts in the Air may be, by expoſing ſome Body, which ſeveral Salts have different Effects on.</item>

                           <p>CLean Copper Plates being placed over Glaſſes, under which, Spirit of Salt and Spirit of Nitre diluted with Water, were ſet. I Oſerved, that they were diſcoloured alike by the aſcending Fumes; it being common for theſe Spirits to draw a green Tincture from Copper as Spirit of Soot and Urine do a Blew one. I have obſerved a piece of Copper brought from a Mine overcaſt in ſeveral Parts with a Verdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greaſe, which effect I judged to depend on the Efficacy of ſome <hi>Effluvia</hi> in the Air.

                           <p>A Third way, which may be taken to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the different Nature of <hi>Effluvia,</hi> may be

<pb n="353" facs="tcp:59609:484"/>grande flamme, qui is a laiſſe une ouverture ſi profonde, que ſi on y jette une pierre, on ne l'entend point tomber. Mais ce qui eſt arrive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puis en ce port, n'eſt pas moins eſtonnant; je le rapperteray icy comme je l'ay appris de di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes perſonnes en pluſieurs endroîts. Ily a environ 18 ans que durant la nuit d'un certain Diamanche, commenca dans le port de Santori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni un tres grand bruit lequel s' entendit jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques à Chio, qui en eſt eloigne deplus de deux cent milles, mais de telle ſorte qu' on crut a Chio que c' eſtoî l'armèe venitienne qui combatroit contre celle des Turcs, ce qui fit que des le matin chacum monta aux lieux les plus elevez pour en eſtre Spectateur, &amp; me ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viens que le Reverend <hi>Pere Bernard</hi> ſuperieur des Capucins de Chio, homme Venerable, &amp; tres digne de foy, me conta qu'il y avoit eſte trompè comme les autres, car il crut auſsî bien qu' eux eux entendre pleuſieurs coups de canon; cependent ils ne virent rien, &amp; en effect ce fut un feu qui ſeprit dans la terre du fond du port de Santorini, &amp; y fit un tel effect, que depuis le matin juſqu' au ſoir il ſortit du fond de la mer quantite de pierres de ponce, qui montient en haut avec tant de roideur &amp; tant de bruit, qu' on euſt dit que ce fusſet autant de caups de ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, &amp; cela infecta tellement l'air, que dans la dite Iſlle de Santorini, il maurut quantite de perſonnes, &amp; pluſieurs de la Meſine Iſle en per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dirent la veue, qu' ils recouvrerent pourtans quelque jours apres. Cette infection s' eſtendît auſi loin que le bruit quî l'avoit precede, car non ſeulement dans cette Iſle, mais meſme a Chio, &amp; a Smyrne, tout l'argent devint rouge,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:59609:485"/>ſoit qu' il fut dans les Coffres, ou dans les po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; &amp; nos Religieux demeurans en ces lieux la me dirent que tous leurs calices en eſtoient devenus rouges. Au bout de quelques jours cette Infection ſe diſſipa, &amp; l'Argent reprit ſa premiere couleur, les pierres de ponce qui ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirent de la couvrirent tellement la mer del'Archipel, que durant quelque temps, quand il Regnoit de certains Vents, il y avoit des ports, qui en eſtoient bouchez, en façon qu' il n'en pouvoit ſortir aucune barque, pour petite qu' elle fut, que ceux qui eſtoient dedans ne ſe fiſſent le Chemin au travers de ces pierres de ponce avec quelques pieux; &amp; on en voit en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor a preſent par toute la mer Mediterranée mais en petite Quantite, cela s' eſtant diſperſe ca et la.

                        <p>It is uſually obſerv'd, that there is a ſtrong ſmell of Sulphur near where a Thunder-bolt falls.

                        </opener>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Celeſtical Effluvia in the Air</note>IN order to diſcover the ſeveral affections of Winy Liquors, and the ſeveral Diſtempers incident to them; and how to preſerve them, it is requiſite to conſider the Qualities of the Air, it's Temperature and Motion.</p>
                        <p>And this puts me in mind to beg our Friends Aſſiſtance, who would do well to make ſome progreſs in perfecting the Theory of the Planets; for if that be not clear, we cannot be free from Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in reſpect of their Motions and Calculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and if we be miſtaken in theſe, i'ts im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to know either their Places in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens or their Aſpects, and conſequently the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:59609:486"/>way of their Motion muſt be uncertain, and of no uſe or advantage.</p>
                        <p>But, tho' by ſome they are looked upon to have little or no influence upon our Globe, yet all the Arguments alledged againſt that Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are rather levelled againſt Aſtronomy, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to ſome Superſtitions about this Doctrine, than that they ſhew, why, when the Rays of each make different Angles upon one another, they may not at the laſt affect us. Since that they do is evident, by undeniable Experiments, not only on inanimate and vegetative Bodies; but likewiſe from the Obſervations of Phyſitians in all Lunatick, Epileptick, Paralitick or Lethargick Perſons.</p>
                        <p>And indeed, ſince Rarefaction and Condenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are mediate Motions, which diſpoſe Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to Corruption, and are aſſiſting in Generat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing New ones; and, ſince all the Affections and diſpoſitions of Moiſture, Heat, Cold, Drought, the Courſe of all Winds, Showers, Thundering, or whatſoever elſe is uſed by Nature, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce theſe two General Effects of Rarefaction and Condenſation, do in a great Meaſure, if not wholly depend upon, and are altogether regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by the Courſe and Aſpects of the Celeſtial Bodies, it will not be irrational to teach, that every one of thoſe, emitting Rays peculiar to themſelves have, by the Influence of thoſe, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Effects on our <hi>Atmoſphere:</hi> The ſubtle parts of the Air being not only ſubject to be work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon by them, but likewiſe our Spirits, and other Humours, whoſe Parts, by the impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe ſubtle Rays, may acquire a new determinate Motion, and conſequently be altered,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:59609:486"/>whence may ariſe Convulſions, Cramps, Lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Accordingly as the Humours influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by them, are differently acted on, and diſpoſed to ſhew their ill Effects in this or that Part.</p>
                        <p>So that it would be of conſiderable Import to Natural Philoſophy, and of no ſmall uſe in Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, Gardening, as well as Phyſick, to make ſuch Obſervations, as might tend to the Improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Theory of the Planets by keeping exact Diàries in ſeveral Places, of the Changes of the Weather, and at the ſame time of the Mutual Aſpects, places and Motions of the Planets; Beſides, it would not a little conduce to the Perfecting of the Natural Hiſtories of Countries, and particular Places.</p>
                        <p>But in inſtituting and perfecting Obſervations of this kind, we are not yet Furniſhed with Thermometers, ſufficiently improved; for,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> We are not yet acquainted, what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion the Diameter of the Cylinder ought to bear to the Diameter of the Head; to make our Obſervations of the Alterations in the Air, regular. <hi>Secondly,</hi> We are not told what Length the Cylinder ought to be; nor hath it as yet been well graduated, 16 being the greateſt Number; whereas to make Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the more Minute alterations, every Inch may be divided into 10, and conſequently the whole into a 1000 Degrees. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We are not yet told what Liquors are moſt proper to make ſuch Experiments with; Whether ſuch as Attract the Air, and preſerve their firſt Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; ſuch as <hi>Ol. Sulph. per Campanam Ol. Vitriol.</hi> or
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:59609:487"/>Liquors, ſuch as <hi>Sal Tartar,</hi> &amp;c. or whether Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors whoſe Parts are more ſubtle and fine, ſuch as Spirit of Wine, or Turpentine; or <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Spirit of Vinegar, or well refined Quickſilver.</p>
                        <p>In making ſuch Experiments, it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to fix ſeveral Glaſſes in one Frame, with ſeveral ſorts of Liquors in them; and that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations ſhould be made in ſeveral Rooms together, the Glaſſes being neither expoſed to the Sun Beams, nor to the injury of Storms, Rain or Winds. In the Hiſtory it ſelf it will be requiſite to give an Account of the very place ſuch Experiments were made in, taking Notice whether the Experiments are not influenced by the Air in the Chimney, the Cranny of a Wall or Door, or the Breath of People. It will be requiſite likewiſe to note the Proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Warmth of Day and Night, in conſtant Weather: The agreement or diſagreement of the Motion of the Air, and Bodies above it in uncertain Weather: How far theſe may foretell Winds or Rain; the diſpoſition of Air, when it Thunders, under times of Mildews or Blaſting, eminent Eclipſes, Conjunctions.</p>
                        <p>It is a Received Tradition in <hi>Java,</hi> that the Beams of the Moon, if one ſtays long under them, will cauſe Contractures; ſo that a Phyſitian, who Slept under them, had his Mouth ſtrangely contorted, and his Neck ſtiff, which Symptoms he removed ſooner than they are wont to go off, by the uſe of Aromatick Medicines.</p>

                        <p>A Learned Phyſitian, that Travelled into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,</hi> told me, that thoſe Countries are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with a conſtant Wind from the Hills; but <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> which wants Hills, hath no ſuch Winds.

To force Air into theſe Gruffs, they place Turfs on the Lee ſide of the Pits Mouth, inſtead of which, if they be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the other ſide, thoſe in the Gruffs are ſeiſed with a want of Breath and Fainting. Sweet Flowers being taken down into them, preſently Stink.

                                 <p>Et par conſequent qu' il faut conſiderer toute la maſſe de l'Air en l'eſtat libre ou elle eſt, de-la meſme ſorte que ſi elle euſt eſte autrefois com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me une maſſe d'eau de 31 pieds de haut á l'en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour de toute la terre, qui euſt eſté rarefiée et di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latée extremement, et convertie en cet eſtat ou nous l'appellons Air, auquel elle occupe à la verite plus de place, mais auquel elle conſerve
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:59609:494"/>preciſement le meſme poids que l'eau à 31 pieds de haut.</p>
                                 <p>Et-comme il n' y auroit rien de plus aiſé que de ſuppter combien l'eau qui environneroit tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te la terre à 31 Pieds de haut peſeroit de livres; et qu' un enfant qui ſcait l'Addition et la Souſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction le pourroit faire; on trouveroit par le meſme moyen combien tout l'Air de la Nature peſe de liures, puiſque c' eſt la meſme choſe; et ſi on en fait l'épreuve, on trouvera qu' il peſe à peu prés huit Millions de Millions de Millions de Liures.</p>
                                 <p>I' ay voulu avoir ce plaiſir, et j' en ay fait le compte en cette ſorte.</p>
                                 <p>I' ay ſuppoſé que le Diametre d'un cercle eſt à ſa circonference, comme 7 à 22.</p>
                                 <p>I' ay ſuppoſe que le Diametre d'une Sphere eſtant multiplié par la circonference de ſon grand cercle, le produit eſt le contenu de la ſuperficie Spherique.</p>

                        <p>The Air at <hi>Morocco,</hi> tho' exceſſive hot in the Day is Cold at Night, as well as the Mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Parts thereabouts.</p>
                        <p>One, who ſtayed a Year in <hi>Guinea,</hi> tho' it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive hot, told me, that about 4 a Clock in the Morning, he was ready to tremble with Cold.</p>
                        <p>One told me, that in <hi>Jamacia,</hi> when he lay in his Hammock about 3 or 4 Foot from the Ground, tho' he had much Cloths under him, yet he perceived it Cold beneath, and Hot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</p>
                        <p>So that to ſhew that not only Liquors, and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Bodies may be affected with the Summers heat, but even Glaſs it ſelf, I ſhall intimate, that Glaſs-ſtopples of Factitious Cryſtal being ſo fitted to Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ols of the ſame, tho' in Winter they would move
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:59609:497"/>about eaſily; yet in the Summer they would not be pull'd out by the Aſſiſtance of a String, till the Expanſion of the Glaſs was taken off by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cool'd in Water.</p>
                        <p>I am apt to believe, that ſeveral Effects, which we are apt to attribute to the Heat of the Air, putting the Parts of the Juices of our Bodies in Motion, depend on ſome <hi>Effluvia</hi> rais'd by Heat from other Bodies, and which ſwim in the Air.</p>
                        <p>A large Piece of Amber being plac'd in the Summer in the Sun-Beams, had its Parts put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch an Agitation, as enabled it to emit Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrical <hi>Effluvia,</hi> and to attract light Bodies, which Power it would loſe when remov'd out of the Sun-Beams again.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Nickſon</hi> told me, that, near <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s <hi>Bay,</hi> when they were a <hi>Leeward</hi> of certain floating Iſlands of Ice, they were ſenſible of it by a new Acceſs of Cold; before they approach'd ſo near as to ſee them, which was at 20 Miles diſtance. He likewiſe told me, that that Wind brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with it a Foggy Air; And that in that of <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s <hi>Bay</hi> where he winter'd, the Rivers were not free from Ice from the latter End of <hi>October,</hi> to the middle or end of <hi>May,</hi> tho' the Latitude of <hi>Charlton</hi> Iſland, moſt frequented by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> was of the ſame Latitude with <hi>London,</hi> and at the moſt not exceeding 52 Degrees: The Ice was near ſix Foot deep; and the Froſt ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that Bottles of Brandy would have a fourth Part turn'd into Ice, the unfroze Liquor being much ſtronger than before: The Ice which ſwam upon the Water was freſh, from whence they ſupply'd themſelves with freſh Water, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:59609:498"/>by melting it in their Pots, or by gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it from large Cavities in floating pieces of Ice, where it was melted by the Sun-Beams.</p>
                        <p>A Traveller told me, that upon the Top of a <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountain in the Summer it was very hot, tho' the ſame Day it was cover'd with Snow; and another told me, that the Winds at <hi>Morocco</hi> were ſo hot, as almoſt to ſtifle him.</p>
                        <p>And it hath been obſerv'd, upon the Tops of high <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountains, that, below them there were Clouds which yielded Rain plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, out of which Lightning flaſh'd upwards as well as downwards.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <hi>Stubbs</hi> told me, that in a Bolt-head about 2 Foot ½ long, about 7 or 8 a Clock in the Morning, which is the faint time of the Day, the Water would riſe but ¼ of Inch and half a quarter, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which time it would ſubſide till that time the next Day. He further added, that in 8 or 10 Months time in that hot Country, Water would not decreaſe in Quantity, tho' kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopp'd.</p>
                        <p>I am told by another, that in the <hi>Torrid Zone</hi> near the Coaſt of <hi>Sumatra,</hi> tho' Ice nor Froſt nor Snow are ever obſerv'd, yet he hath known Hail to fall. And I am told, that in the Iſland of <hi>Ceylon,</hi> which lies betwixt 6 and 10 Degrees <hi>North</hi> Latitude in that Torrid Climate, it would be ſo cold at the Top of ſome Hills, to whoſe Tops they could aſcend in half an hour, that they would almoſt ſhiver. And Capt. <hi>Knox</hi> told me, that having ſpent 18 Years in that Iſland, he obſerv'd a kind of Meteor in Winters Mornings between a Dew and a hoar Froſt, which
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:59609:498"/>preſently vaniſh'd; and that once there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd a ſhower of Hail, which were about the ſize of a black Cherry, but were preſently melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Ground.</p>
                        <p>The Heat is ſo violent in the Iſland <hi>Suaquena,</hi> that it excoriates the Skin, melts <hi>Indian</hi> Wax in a Cabinet, and ſears your Shoes like a red hot Iron. Yet on ſome Mountains in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> they dread Cold more than Heat; tho' no Snow falls, but only a little Hail now and then, which ſoon melts; and <hi>Telleſius</hi> witneſſes, that in many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> the Air is more mild than in <hi>Portugal,</hi> ſo many Degrees diſtant <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>

                           <p>But to proceed: What was further obſerv'd by Mr. <hi>Clappham</hi> and others, who purpoſely aſcended this Mountain: As ſoon as they were got a Mile in their Aſcent upon the <hi>Pico,</hi> ſome of them grew faint and ſick, ſeveral that aſcended were taken with Fluxes and Vomitings, and were Aguiſh; their Horſes, and even their Wine as well as themſelves being extreamly cold. When they had aſcended a Mile further, they
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:59609:503"/>came to the black Rocks, from whence they travell'd over a white Sand, ſo hot that it burnt the Skin of a Dog's Feet who went up with Dr. <hi>Pugh.</hi> When they came to the Top, there were ſulphureous Steams copiouſly aſcending and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, which were ſo hot, that they made their Faces ſore, and at a little diſtance appear'd like Smoak.</p>
                           <p>There was little Alteration in the Wind, till we came to the Top, where it was very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous. The ſtrong Waters there had loſt their Force, but the Wine ſeem'd rather more Spirituous.</p>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin">An account of the <hi>Pico.</hi>
                              </note>Upon the Top is a Pit call'd <hi>Caldera,</hi> of a Coni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Figure, which is about 80 Yards deep, and a Muſquet-ſhot over; It is cover'd over with looſe Stones, Sulphur and Sand, which being ſtirr'd, very offenſive Vapours are rais'd; it is dangerous to go further than 4 or 5 Yards into it, becauſe their Feet are apt to ſlip from under them. In the Bottom is a ſort of clearer Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, which looks like Salt upon the Stones.</p>
                           <p>From hence they could ſee the Grand <hi>Canaries, Palma</hi> and <hi>Gomera,</hi> and <hi>Hiero,</hi> 20 Leagues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.

From whence we may conjecture, that ſeveral Salts which act joyntly, may be ſo ſeparated by ſupervening Qualities in the Air, as to act ſeparately.</p>

                     <p n="1">I. If a little Spirit of Salt be mix'd with Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of Violets upon a piece of Paper, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently turn'd from a Blew, to a red Colour incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to a Purple.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. But if Spirit of Salt be dropp'd in a juſt Proportion into a Solution of Filings of Copper, made with Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> the Blew will be turn'd into a green Colour.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Having mixed Syrup of Violets with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Urine, Harts-horn or Oyl of Tartar <hi>per Deliquium,</hi> and by that means turn'd it green, I mix'd Spirit of Salt with it, which turn'd it red.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. If Spirit of Salt be dropp'd into Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in which Red Roſe Leaves well dry'd are put, it will make the Tincture to be of a love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Red.</p>
                     <pb n="437" facs="tcp:59609:528"/>
                     <p n="5">V. But if Tincture of Braſil be heightned by an addition of Spirit of Hartshorn, or Urine, Spirit of Salt will make it as pale as Sack; ſo that that which heightened the Red Tincture in the former Experiment, deſtroys it in this.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. Tho an Infuſion of <hi>Lignum Nephriticum</hi> in Water, betwixt it and the Light appears yellow, yet when held ſo that the Eye may be placed betwixt it and the Window, it appears to be blew, yet upon the dropping of Spirit of Salt into it, it loſes that property.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. Having dropped Spirit of Salt upon Paper ſtained with Ink, the black was preſently changed into a yellow and blew colour.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. If Filings of Steel be diſſolved in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Salt, the filtrated Liquor will, upon Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, ſhoot into green Criſtals; which, if when they are dry they be kept in a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, a moderate Heat will turn them red.</p>

                        <p>THO there are ſome, eſpecially Chymiſts, who think that a conſiderable Diverſity of Colours,<note place="margin">Diverſity of Colour not always an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a variety in Qualities.</note> muſt always imploy a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Nature; yet we ſee, that Taffaties are endued with changable Colours, as well as the Feathers of ſeveral Birds, which have as great an Affinity in Nature as in Place; and not only ſeveral Feathers vary in Colour from one another, but ſometimes ſeveral parts of the ſame Feather: And there is no leſs variety of Colour in ſeveral Leaves of Flowers, tho no difference can be diſcovered in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties: A conſiderable Inſtance in which, we have in <hi>Marvail</hi> of <hi>Peru,</hi> which tho it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces ſeveral Scores of Flowers in its Seaſon, yet I have ſcarce found two coloured alike.</p>

                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Yet changes of Colour oft ſignify Alteration in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of Bodies.</note>But tho I believe that a variety of Colours does not always imply a Diverſity of Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet I queſtion not, but that an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in point of Colour, ſignifies a Variation in the Diſpoſition of Parts of Bodies; which is evident in the Extraction of Tinctures, and ſeveral other Chymical Operations, wherein the Change of Colours is the only Obſervation by which the Artiſt regulates his Proceſs. So we ſee, that ſeveral Degrees of Maturation produces various Colours in Fruit; and Steel, if it be heated glowing hot in the fire, and held over a Baſion of Water, till it changes its white to a red Colour, ſo far as is then quench'd will be hard'ned, and when poliſh'd at the end, will look whitiſh; but if the end of the Steel be held in a Candle, ſo that the poliſh'd part may not be ſully'd, that which is almoſt contiguous to the Candle, would change from a bright Yellow to a deep one, or a ſanguine Blew, and from that to a fainter, and then to a deeper Blew; and in each of theſe diffetent Appearances, its Texture is ſo much different, that if whilſt it is yellow it be cooled, it is fit for Gravers Drills, but when blew, it is ſofter and fit for Springs of Watches; and if it be kept long in the flame after this blew appears, it will be too ſoft for Drills till hardned again. And it is not a little pleaſant to ſee how theſe Colours will ſucceed one another and run along the Steel very faſt. But becauſe the flame of a Candle uſually ſullies the Steel, we generally make uſe of a red-hot Iron to heat it with.</p>
                        <p>But not to proſecute theſe Experiments out of their due Place, before I deſcend more Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:59609:531"/>to preſent you with my Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning Colours,<note place="margin">What is meant by Colour.</note> I think it requiſite to premiſe, That Colour being a Word of a twofold Signification, in the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I ſhall ſometimes uſe it to ſignifie on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Senſation of thoſe reflected and modified Rays of Light, which cauſe that Effect on the Senſory; and generally, in the vulgar Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, intimating by it, the Diſpoſition in the Object which cauſes the Rays of Light to be reflected, ſo as to produce on the Senſory this or that Colour.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">What the Perception of Colours depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>And, perhaps, it may not be inconvenient to add, that it is the Opinion of ſeveral Modern Atomiſts, that the Senſation of Colours depends not ſo much on the inherent Qualities of the Object in the Senſe, but that ſuch a Motion is given to the Spirits in the <hi>Retina,</hi> that that communicated to the Brain, and cauſing a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Motion in ſome part of it, we always think we ſee ſuch a colour, when the ſlender ſtrings of the <hi>Retina</hi> are put into a like Motion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Light concurs to the Production of that Motion or not; whence dreaming Men often think they ſee ſeveral things in their ſleep; and diſtracted Perſons fancy they ſee ſeveral things before them, which depends only upon an Internal Local Motion of their Spirits: And ſo upon a violent blow upon the Eye, we ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fancy we ſee Lightning and flaſhes of Fire; and even upon a blow on the Head, or when internal Humours cauſe ſuch a Concuſſion in the extremities of the Optick Nerves, as is wont to produce a Senſation of Light. And I remember, that having my ſelf a violent
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:59609:531"/>Cough, I fancy'd I ſaw flaſhes of Light, which preſently diſappear'd again: and a very diſcreet Lady obſerv'd, that the day before ſhe was ſeiz'd with ſome violent Hyſterick and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriacal Fits, which for the time gave her a baſtard Palſey, every thing before her ſeem'd to be dyed with bright and vivid, but unuſual colours: And I am told by an ingenious Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, that ſeveral that were ſeiz'd with the Plague, ſometime before, fancy'd every thing coloured over very beautifully; and this Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom was ſucceſsfully remov'd, as well as the other Symptoms of that Diſtemper by a Vomit The Vomit which was ſucceſsfully given in this was made of about 8 or 10 Drachms of <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Metallorum,</hi> and half a Drachm of white Vitriol.</p>
                        <p>But further, as the Apparition of a Colour may be caus'd by the Motion of the Humors within, ſo the Senſory being Indiſpoſed, that Indiſpoſition may vary the appearance of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Objects: For I have taken notice, that after looking upon the Sun or Moon with a Teleſcope, my Eye hath been ſo alter'd, that the flame of a Candle ſeem'd to vary much in its colour from what it uſed to be, and if I often open'd and ſhut my Eye whilſt that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious Colour ſeem'd to laſt, I could diſcern it gradually diminiſh, till the Candle appear'd to me as before; and one thing worthy of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice was, that if I looked upon the Object with one Eye, when the dazled Eye was ſhut, the Adventitious Colour diſappear'd, but was viſible again, upon opening the dazled Eye.</p>
                        <pb n="444" facs="tcp:59609:532"/>
                        <p>To this Obſervation I ſhall add, that a Lady, who had by a Fall, got a Hurt near her Eye, for ſix Weeks together fancy'd every thing co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd over with very dazling and glorious Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, eſpecially white Bodies, ſome of which were ſuch as ſhe could not deſcribe. And a Learned Gentleman told me, that looking upon the Sun with a good Teleſcope, without a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd Glaſs to guard his Sight, the Brightneſs of the Object left ſuch an Indiſpoſition in his Eye, that nine or ten Years after, whenever he look'd upon the Window, he fancy'd he ſaw a light Body before his Eye, of the Size and Brightneſs of the Sun, as it appear'd to him in the Teleſcope; to which Inſtances, I could add others from the Experien'd <hi>Epiphanius Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandus,</hi> of the Symptoms of thoſe Bitten by a <hi>Tarantula;</hi> from whence it would appear, that an Indiſpoſition in the Organ of Viſion, is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to vary our Judgment of Colours, but theſe may be more properly deliver'd in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of a Body conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd as the cauſe of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</note>But to proceed, from what hath been ſaid it appears, I allow and teach, that the ſuperficial Parts of a Body, reflecting the Rays of Light, and modifying them, may in one ſenſe be ſaid to be the Cauſe of that Colour it repreſents, ſince as the Beams of Light are variouſly modify'd, we perceive ſeveral Senſations.</p>
                        <p>And tho' ſome hold, that the Rays of Light which conveigh Colours, are not reflected bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Superficies of a Body, but penetrate deeper into it's Subſtance; yet we are apt to call thoſe Bodies tranſparent or ſemidiaphonous, whoſe Subſtance the Rays of Light viſibly inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:59609:532"/>themſelves into: And that in all Bodies there is no ſuch Penetration of Light is evident, ſince ſeveral Subſtances appear to be of one Colour on the outſide, and of another within; which is evident not only in Fruit, but temper'd Steel; for tho' it be furniſh'd with very vivid Colours on the Superficies, yet within a Hairs breadth of it, it retains it's Steel Colour: And a more Eminent Inſtance is, that Lead being melted and pour'd into an Iron Veſſel, when the Scum was taken off, ſeveral Colours ſucceeded one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, upon it's Superficies, and that which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd laſt, before the Metal cool'd, remaining upon the Superficies of it, we found, that if never ſo little was taken off, that adventitious Colour would be taken off too, and the Metal would appear in it's own Colour; which ſhews not only what I alledg'd it for; but alſo, that probably an adventitious Colour may be acquir'd by the Effects the ſaline Parts of the Air, have on Lead ſo diſpos'd to receive it's Impreſſions, which it will not do, till brought to a much higher degree of Fuſion than bare melting. One thing remarkable in theſe Colours was, that they ſucceed not ſo regularly as thoſe in Steel, but in the following order,</p>
                        <p>Viz. <hi>Blew, Yellow, Purple, Blew; Green, Purple Blew, Yellow, Red; Purple, Blew, Yellow and Blew; Yellow, Blew, Purple, Green mixt, Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; Red, Blew, Green, Yellow, Red, Purple, Green.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Tho' it is held by antient Atomiſts, that the Figure of a Body is ſufficient to vary it's Colour;
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:59609:533"/>yet I am perſwaded, that there are other things requiſite; ſince we ſee by the help of good Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcopes, that the Superficies of Bodies are not only full of ſeveral Protuberances, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſeveral Cavities, which appear not to the naked Eye; ſo that the very Figures of thoſe may have a great ſtroke in cauſing various Colours, and differently forming the Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of a Body, ſo as to enable it variouſly to reflect the Rays of Light, and cauſe different Effects in our Organ of Senſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Figures of the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Parts requiſite for the Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</note>But beſides the various Figures of theſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial Particles, the Surface of a Body may be enabled variouſly to reflect the Rays of Light, as they are bigger or leſs; and the Protuberant Particles are ſet cloſer, or at a greater diſtance: So Water if it have but a few Bubbles on the Top of it, hath ſcarce any ſenſible Colour, but if it be beaten into a Froth, and a great number of Bubbles are cloſe ſet, it preſently varies it's Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and ſeems white; to which not only the Number, but the Convex Superficies of the Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles conduce; nor is it requiſite, that all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuberant Corpuſcles ſhould be of one Figure, ſince, thoſe which produce a Blew, and thoſe that yield a Yellow being mix'd together, afford a green Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. But further, the Cavities intercepted betwixt the Protuberant Parts and their Figures, are to be conſider'd in the Production of Colours, as well as the Figure and Size of the Particles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: For the Superficies of a Body may be cut tranſverſly with a Methamatical Plain, void of Depth or Thickneſs, above which as well as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, may be ſeveral Superficies, as in the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the Earth, there may be ſeveral Parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:59609:533"/>the Horizontal Plain as well as below; upon which Account, the Rays of Light may be ſo differently reflected, as to cauſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Colours; ſo the two ſides of a Piece of red Glaſs ſeem differently colour'd, when the one is Rough, and the other Poliſh'd; and tho' ſeveral ſorts of Marbles are never ſo curiouſly Poliſh'd, yet their Superficies ſo far vary, as to exhibit diſtinct Colours.</p>
                        <p>

<pb n="448" facs="tcp:59609:534"/>green, the Rays which were reflected from the Soil being intercepted.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The Motion of the part of a Body contribute to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</note>And that the motion of the Parts of a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, may contribute to the change of a Colour, I am perſwaded, ſince I have elſewhere men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd a Liquor, which, whilſt it was at reſt, would be clear and tranſparent, but when it's Parts were put into Motion, they would riſe up and form a white Fume; and the like Fumes I have obſerv'd to riſe from a Liquor diapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, and another red. And if the Superficies of a Body be made up of Parts, whoſe different ſides afford ſeveral Colours, then the Motion or Reſt of that Body may contribute to the variation or continuance of a Colour, ſince a new ſide being turn'd towards the Eye, we muſt conſequently ſee a new Colour; ſo when the Leaves of a Tree, whoſe Colour on each ſide varies, are forced by the Wind, to appear with their other ſides outward, they exhibit a new Colour, tho' a few of them makes no conſiderable Alteration; as a ſingle Thred of Scarlet, ſeems almoſt void of Redneſs; but when ſeveral of them are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced together, their Colour becomes more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous. So likewiſe in a Piece of Taffety which is made of red and blew Threds inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven, I found by a Microſcope, that when the Silk was ſo commodiouſly placed, that the blew Threds were not intercepted by the red ones, the Colour would be blew; but when the red Threds were more commodiouſly placed than the others, the Colour would vary: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it would not be amiſs to endeavour to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a Reaſon, by the Uſe of Microſcopes, why Mother of Pearl, Opals and ſuch like Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59609:534"/>are of ſuch curious Colours, and what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture of Parts is apt to produce Colours ſo delightful.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">How far Aſperity contributes to Colours.</note>But till we are furniſh'd with better Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopes, or more exquiſite Senſes, I fear theſe things muſt be undiſcover'd, ſince there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral degrees of Aſperity, and the Parts which form them are ſo minute, that we are not able to know how their Shades are mix'd with, or intercepted one by another; tho' I was told by Dr. <hi>Finch,</hi> that there was a Blind Man at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricht,</hi> not far from <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tretcht,</hi> who was able to diſtinguiſh ſimple Colours by the Touch, tho' mix'd Colours he could not diſcern: And</p>
                        <p>The Account this Man gave the Doctor of his Senſations of thoſe Colours was, that Black and White were the moſt Aſperous Colours, and ſo like, that it was hard to diſtinguiſh them; but Black was the rougher of the two; Green next to it, Gray next to Green, Yellow a degree below that, Red and Blew ſo much alike, that they were hard to be diſtinguiſh'd, but that Blew was the leaſt rough of the two; and theſe Diverſities of Surfaces this Man diſcover'd, by placing the Body whoſe Colours he was to try betwixt his Thumb and his Fore-finger; And it was very remarkable, that his Thumb was not only the moſt ſenſible of the two, but that he had only this Exquiſiteneſs of Senſe when faſting, the leaſt drink diſabling him, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh ſo nicely the difference of Colours.</p>
                        <p>But I am apt to ſuſpect, that this blind Man rather diſcriminated theſe different Colours by the Smell of the ingredients, than the Touch; and that if the Organ of Touch contributed to
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:59609:535"/>it, it rather did it, by diſcovering the ſeveral <hi>Forms</hi> than <hi>Degrees</hi> of Aſperity, ſince he found it ſo difficult to diſtinguiſh Black and White from one another, tho' not from other Colours; and indeed tho' the Ribbons which were offer'd might be almoſt equally rough, yet in ſuch ſlender Corpuſcles as thoſe which reflect the Rays of Light, we may eaſily conceive, not only a greater cloſeneſs of Parts, or a paucity of extant Parts, but that they may be otherwiſe ranged, and the Cavities left betwixt, much deeper in one than the other; for ſuppoſing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuberant Particles to be very ſlender, and cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drical like the Hair of a Bruſh, and furniſh'd with Hemiſpherical Tops, they may be ſo very ſharp, that a leſs exquiſite Touch, cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh them, than that of this blind Man. Nor is every kind of Roughneſs inconſiſtent with Whiteneſs ſince the level Superficies of Water being made rough by Bubbles, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquires a Whiteneſs, and ſo does Glaſs when ſcratch'd with a Diamond.</p>
                        <p>But to proceed, ſuppoſing the ſharp pointed Particles which are ranged upon the Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of black and white Bodies were ſo like, that the Touch could not diſtinguiſh them ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily; yet upon the Account of ſome difference in the Cavities, which intercept the Rays of Light, they may variouſly reflect it; as if the Cavities of a black Body be deep, and the other ſuperficial, the one will drown and detain the Rays of Light, whilſt the others undiſturbedly reflect them. From whence it appears, that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours rather depend on different Forms of Aſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, than on different degrees of it; and tho'
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:59609:535"/>the blind Man tells us, that Black was the rougheſt of Colours, yet it does not therefore follow, that thoſe Bodies which have the leaſt Aſperities, muſt be the lighteſt, and reflect the Rays of Light moſt, ſince according to him, White is the rougheſt next to Black; and tho' he aſſigns Yellow two degrees leſs of Aſperity than Green, and as many more than Blew, yet it is manifeſtly to the Eye a lighter Colour, and reflects the Rays of Light more plentifully than either.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">How many ways Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors may alter Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</note>But to return to what I was ſaying of the different Aſperities of Bodies, by which Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours may be diverſify'd: To aſſiſt us to judge of the Reaſon of the Changes in Colours pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by corroſive ſaline Corpuſcles in a fluid Form, I ſhall conſider how many ways ſuch Liquors may, by working upon them, alter the Superficies of Bodies upon which they act, and conſequently cauſe them variouſly to reflect the Rays of Light.</p>
                        <p>And <hi>First,</hi> Such Liquors may alter the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of Bodies, by inſinuating and lodging their ſmall Particles in the Pores of a Body: So Oyl or Water dropp'd upon Paper, alters the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of it; and the High Road upon Rain loſes it's dry Colour, and changes it for another.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> A Liquor may alter the Colour of a Body, by freeing it from an adventitious Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; as when the dirty Colour of Gold is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off by putting it into the fire or <hi>Aq. Fortis.</hi> And not only Silver may be reſtored by the like means to it's genuine Luſtre, but I know a vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Liquor, which, incorporating with Greaſe, will take ſuch Stains out of Cloaths. And I have try'd, that having rubb'd a Compound Metalline Body
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:59609:536"/>on a Touch-ſtone, <hi>Aq. Fortis</hi> would take off all the other Ingredients, and leave the Gold, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing with its genuine Colour.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A Liquor may alter the Colour of a Body, either by deſtroying or ſubdividing the Parts of it; as when Wood is cut into Chips, or a piece of hot Cryſtal quench'd in cold Water, for it being by that means crack'd, will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect the Rays of Light as before.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> A Liquor may change the Colour of another Body, by collecting together Parts of Matter ſcatter'd and diſpers'd; ſo Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver pour'd into a Solution of Gold, acquires a thin Film, of a yellow golden Colour; and by a like Method all thoſe Colours, that ſeem to be produc'd by Precipitation, are generated; tho' Reſinous Gums diſſolv'd in Spirit of Wine being unites into a Maſs again; and ſo rectify<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>d tranſparent Butter of Antimony, upon a Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Water precipitates that white Subſtance, which when it's Salts are waſh'd off, is called <hi>Mercurius Vitae.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A Fifth way, by which a Liquor may alter the Colour of another Body, is, by altering the Texture of it's Parts, as, when Quickſilver is kept long in a convenient Heat; Metals are corroded, or Fruit is bruiſed; or when the Parts of a Liquor are agitated by the Affuſion of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Body; or when Chymical Oyls are ſhaken in a Bottle; for the Bubbles by that means rais'd will exhibit very lively Colours.</p>
                        <p>Another way, is, by putting the Parts of a Body into Motion, after which they may unite in a new Form; ſo Vitriol rubb'd upon the Blade of a Knife, imparts not any new Colour to it;
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:59609:536"/>but if the Vitriol be moiſten'd, it will impart a true Copper Colour to the Iron.</p>
                        <p>Another way by which a new Colour may be imparted to a Liquor, is, by an Aſſociation of it's ſaline Parts with thoſe of the Body it is made uſe of to work upon, by which means the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Parts of a Body, may be alter'd both in Shape and Figure; and not only a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or a leſs, may be compriz'd in the ſame ſpace, but the Pores betwixt the Protuberant Parts may be much ſtraitned, and the old ones partly fill'd up, as well as new ones intercept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as when Quickſilver is diſſolv'd in <hi>Aq. Fortis,</hi> the ſaline Parts of the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> aſſociating themſelves with the Mercurial Corpuſcles, will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a Green, which afterwards degenerates eaſily. And ſo <hi>Minium</hi> by being diſſolv'd in Spirit of Vinegar, yields a clear Solution; and if <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> be dropp'd upon a Copper Plate, the Parts of the Metal being corroded, acquire an Aſperity, and coagulating with the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> form Grains of blew Vitriol, whereas Spirit of Urine will produce a much deeper Blew. And <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> which will give Red Lead a dark Colour, with crude Lead will produce a white one, with Iron, a reddiſh, and upon white Quills a yellowiſh Colour. And that in Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Diſſolutions and Precipitations the ſaline Parts of the Body made uſe of to precipitate, unite with metalline Parts they precipitate, we ſhall have reaſon to believe if we conſider how much Vitriol, and the <hi>Calces</hi> of Metals are heavier than the Metals themſelves.</p>
                        <p>After what we have laid down concerning the Cauſes of Changes of Colours, there are
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:59609:537"/>two things to be taken Notice of; The one is, that there are other ways to vary Colours ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, beſides thoſe we have taken notice of by the help of Liquors; as in Tempering Steel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſecond Particular requiſite to be noted is, that tho' a Change of Colour may be effected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one of the ways above-mention'd, yet gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally at leaſt three of them are at once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Several Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed opacous ſemidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanous.</note>From what we have been diſcourſing of the Aſperities of Bodies in cauſing a Reflection of the Rays of Light, one would think that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances themſelves are perfectly opacous and impenetrable by the Rays of Light, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the Variety of Colours, reflected to the Eye: But I am apt to believe, that even thoſe Bodies which we call Inſenſible, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of Parts ſtill more minute, whoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſures are not utterly impervious to the Rays of Light, and that the Bodies compounded of thoſe are in ſome degree Diaphanous. For in a dark Room, where the Light is only permitted to enter at one Hole, I have obſerv'd, that thoſe Motes which were otherwiſe inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; in the Beams of Light, would repreſent ſeveral vivid and florid Colours, like thoſe of a Rainbow, or of ſparkling Fragments of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds; and as ſoon as that Poſition, which they had at that time, in reference to the Eye and the Light, was loſt, they ceas'd to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thoſe Colours, tho' ſtill remain'd viſible; ſo that from hence it appear'd, that theſe ſmall Fragments of Matter, commonly reputed Opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous, did not barely reflect, but alſo refracted the Rays of Light: And it is not a <hi>Phaenomenon</hi>
                           <pb n="455" facs="tcp:59609:537"/>altogether to be ſlighted, that Water, tho' a diaphanous Body, hath a manifeſt Power in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fracting the Rays of Light ſo, that by paſſing through it, they repreſent the lively Colours of a Rainbow.</p>
                        <p>And it is further obſervable, that ſeveral Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which are generally eſteem'd Opacous, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in a great meaſure tranſparent, when they are reduc'd into thin Parts, and interpos'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Eye and a Powerful Light, which is evident in thin Plates of Ivory, thick Leaves of Trees, Shells of Fiſhes and ſhavings of Wood. And in a darkned Room I found, that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of my Hand was in a great meaſure tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparent, when it was held betwixt my Eyes and the Rays of Light which came in at a ſmall Hole.</p>
                        <p>And not only white Marble of a convenient Thickneſs, but <hi>Lapis Specularis,</hi> or Muſcovite Glaſs, being divided into thin Plates, will be conſiderably tranſparent; and even Coral it ſelf will manifeſt the ſame Tranſparency if held near the Light.</p>
                        <p>But on the other hand, I muſt own, that having look'd upon Mercury precipitate <hi>per ſe,</hi> Filings of Copper and Steel, the Red <hi>Calx</hi> of Lead, and the Red Colour of Vitriol, they appear'd not to have the leaſt Tranſparency.</p>
                        <p>How far the Tranſparency or Semidiapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neity of Bodies may contribute to the Variety of Colours produc'd by them, I ſhall not take upon me to determine, ſince beaten Glaſs, Snow and Ice, whoſe ſuperficial Parts are manifeſtly tranſparent, repreſent not the lively Colours
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:59609:538"/>which they do when conveniently qualifi'd by their Bigneſs, Shape and Texture.</p>
                        <p>But to draw an Inference from what hath been ſaid of the Cauſe of Colours; It appears, that according to the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> we have laid down, Bodies can only be ſaid to be coloured when placed in the Light; but that, according to the Antients, if we take the Senſe of the Word Colour, to mean only that Diſpoſition of the ſuperficial Surface of a Body, which enables it to modifie the Rays of Light; They may be ſaid to have Colours in the Dark, ſince they have that Diſpoſition, which enables them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect the Rays of Light in ſuch a Form as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Colours.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The ſhort duration of Colours no Argument of their not being ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine.</note>And from what hath been deliver'd, it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe appears, that tho' Colours which are eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nid, and laſt but for a while, as the Colours of the Rain-bow, and all Emphatical Colours, are generally diſtinguiſh'd from True and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine ones, in as much as the latter are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by Reflection, and theſe proceed from Refraction; yet, ſince we uſually account all Ecchoes genuine Sounds, and all Smells true Smells, in as much as they are real Objects of the reſpective Senſories they affect, by the ſame Reaſon we may conclude theſe Emphatical Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours genuine, ſince the Rays of Light equally affect our Senſory for the time: And tho' the ſhortneſs of their Continuance hath been offer'd as an Argument of their not being genuine, by the ſame Rule we might ſay, that the Colour of Graſs is not genuine, becauſe the Colour of an Emerald is more laſting; but white Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Froth is held to be genuine, tho' it is
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:59609:538"/>ſoon generated, and in a little time deſtroy'd. Beſides, were the Whiteneſs of Froth accounted an imaginary Colour, we muſt no longer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſuch to be diſtinguiſh'd from genuine ones, by Refraction; ſince Froth retains it's White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whether the Sun be ſetting, riſing, or at the Meridian; the Poſition of the Sun in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Eye, and the Object not at all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſifying it.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, were a Colour to be pronounced genuine by the time of it's Duration, the white Froth of a Tenacious Body, might be ſaid to be more genuine, becauſe it will continue much longer, than the Colour of thoſe Flowers of the <hi>Mervail of Peru,</hi> which fade the very day they are Blown: And I have ſeen a <hi>Virginian</hi> Flower, which ſeldom continues longer than a day.</p>
                        <p>And that the bare Diſpoſition of the Parts of a Body, by which it is ſaid to reflect or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fract the Rays of Light is ſufficient to produce different Colours, is not only evident in Cloth held in ſeveral Poſitions, by which means it variouſly reflects the Rays of Light; but it is further evident, ſince the Beams of the Sun tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected through a Priſmatical Glaſs, repreſent a lively and vivid Rain-bow, upon any Body up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they terminate, which may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd by the Eye, plac'd in any Poſition what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, <hi>viz.</hi> whether above, or below, or on the ſide of the Glaſs. And tho' when the Priſm is taken away, the Rain-bow diſappears, yet nevertheleſs, the Light, for the time being truly reflected and refracted from the Priſm, and reflected again from the Body, which thoſe <gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">

                        <p>But ſince I pretend not this Diſcourſe to be a compleat Hiſtory of Colours, I ſhall only in their proper Place deliver ſome Experiments, which may ſhew the Inſufficiency of the Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teticks and the Doctrine of the Chymiſts, and in favour of that opinion which I am moſt inclin'd to be of; which is, that Colour is a Modification of the Beams of Light, which they receive from the Object, from whence being reflected to the Eye, they cauſe that Senſation we call Colour. But how they come to be ſo modify'd, I ſhall not take upon me to declare, till I know both what Light is it ſelf, and what figur'd Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles it conſiſts of, and likewiſe their Size and Motion: And before I pretend to lay down my Opinion, I would further be ſatisfy'd what is the Nature of Refraction, and what degrees of Commixture of Shades with the Light, made in the ſuperficial Parts of a Body is requiſite to produce this or that Colour.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>But tho' this Account be ingenious enough, yet I ſhall to render it more full: Add, that
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:59609:540"/>Whiteneſs conſider'd as a Quality in the Object, depends on the Aſperity of the Surface of a Body, whoſe Parts are ſo ranged as to reflect the Rays of Light, not upon one another, but upon the Spectators Eye, and that too, barely by reflecting them as a Looking-glaſs does, without Refraction; for in moſt other Colours they are ſo ranged, as either to alter the Texture of the reflected Light, or to vary it with Shades; but in reflecting the Rays of Light to repreſent the Body white, it is not only requiſite, that the reflected Beams ſhould be unalter'd, but likewiſe, that they ſhould almoſt all be reflected back, ſo that ſome of them facing one way, and ſome ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they may obvert themſelves to the Eye on which ſide ſoever it is placed.</p>
                     <p>To illuſtrate this Opinion with Experiments and Obſervations, I ſhall firſt obſerve, that the Colour of the Sun at Mid-day in clear Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is much more near to a Whiteneſs, than when ſtain'd by ſublunary Bodies, and than when near the Horizon, where it's Rays have a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Quantity of Atmoſpherical Parts of Matter to paſs through; and Water it ſelf the more it is ſhin'd on appears to be much whiter to the Spectators: And I have taken notice, that the Sun when cover'd with a white Cloud, hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in the Water to be not red, but white: And it is obſerv'd by Smiths, that Iron, which when moderately hot appears red, when it hath acquir'd a higher degree of Ignition, it ſeems to be white.</p>
                     <p>So thoſe that have weak Eyes complain of too great a Reflection of Light, when the Ground is cover'd with Snow; and it is atteſted by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:59609:540"/>Writers and other Travellers, that the Whiteneſs of the Sun hath been ſo great, that in <hi>Muſcovy</hi> and <hi>Ruſſia</hi> they found the Snow, to reflect the Light ſo much, that they could ſee much farther upon ſnowy Ground, than we here in <hi>England</hi> where no Snow lies on the Ground; ſo that they could ſee their way by the bare Reflection of the Snow, when the Sun did not ſhine. Tho' I am apt to believe, that the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect might in ſome meaſure proceed from the Clearneſs of the Air, cleans'd of thoſe Steams which ſometimes darken it; ſince it appears, that we are able in a froſty Night by reaſon of the clearneſs of the Air, to diſcern more Stars than at other times.</p>
                     <p>And that white Bodies reflect the Rays of Light moſt plentifully, and have no native Light of their own appears, ſince Snow en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed in a dark Room was not at all viſible: But on the contrary it is obſerv'd, that white Cloths are the moſt eaſily diſcerned in dark Nights.</p>
                     <p>And for a further Confirmation that white Bodies reflect the Rays of Light not only moſt plentifully, but from themſelves; I ſhall add, that if the Rays of Light, which enter into a dark Room at a ſmall Hole, Light upon a white Wall, they Enlighten the Room much further than if they fall upon any other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. And that white Bodies caſt moſt Rays of Light from themſelves appears, ſince, white Paper is not near ſo apt to be ſet on fire by a Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Glaſs as black, the concentred Beams be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reflected back much more by the one than the other. To which I ſhall further add, that,
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:59609:541"/>I have perceiv'd a much greater degree of Heat, when I have held my Hand in the Sun Beams, with a black Glove on; than when it was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a White one.</p>
                     <p>And to ſhew that white Bodies not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect the Rays of Light plentifully, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd, I ſhall add, that in a dark Room, when the Rays reflected from a coloured Body, were thrown upon a white Wall, they would repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Colour of that Body, whereas, if the Beams Reflected from a yellow Body upon a blew, it would make a green.</p>
                     <p>And to theſe I ſhall further add, on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, that having caſt the Rays of a troubled Water, by the help of a Lenticular Glaſs, into an upper Room darkened, the concenter'd Reflections of the glittering Waves at a few Paces diſtance, repreſented a white Body; but if we approached near the Place on which thoſe Rays were caſt, they only ſeem'd to be Beams reflected from glittering Waves, which appear'd like ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhining Scales of Fiſhes, ſucceeding each other ſucceſſively and diſappearing again. But if the ſeeming Whiteneſs of a River, proceed not from the reflection of the Sun Beams, but the brightneſs of the Sky, a Storm may cauſe the Surface of it to appear Black, the Rays of Light, being reflected more inward than out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; except near the Sea Shore, where the Surface of the agitated Water is covered with Froth.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The Surfaces of White Bodies Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</note>But to ſhew, that the Surfaces of white Bodies are Specular, I ſhall Subjoyn, that drops of Mercury being rais'd, by a convenient heat in an Alembick, repreſented ſo many looking
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:59609:541"/>Glaſſes, but cauſed the ſides of the Glaſs they ſtuck to, to appear White: And it's obſerv'd, that if we look upon the Milky Way or Gallaxy, with a Teleſcope, tho' to our Eye it appears White, by the help of that we ſhall diſcover, that that Whitneſs only depended upon a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the Rays of Light, whoſe confuſed Beams repreſented to the Eye, a white Body; and why for a like Reaſon, the Superficies of a Body, which to the Eye reflects the Beams confuſedly may not appear White, as well as the Planets which ſhine by a borrow'd Light, I ſee no contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory Reaſon</p>
                     <p>But to return to Experiments, we ſee, that the whites of Eggs, which are in ſome meaſure Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Speculums, by being beaten into a Froth appear White. And if Oyl of Turpentine be mixed with Water, and ſhaken in a Vial, as the Particles of the Oyl are more or leſs numerous, and minutely divided, it appears more or leſs White; which Experiment will likewiſe ſucceed if tryed with a yellow Mixture of crude Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine, inſtead of the Oyl; and likewiſe with an Oyl dyed Green with a Tincture of Copper. And for a like Reaſon the Water which is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried over with Oyls diſtilled in an Alembick, appears White, as long as the globular Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Oyl Swim in it; and hot Water is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to be conſiderably Whiteſt and Opacous when the hot Vapours diſper'd through it, ſtop the Paſſages of the Rays of Light, and cauſe them to fly from it, more plentifully upon the Eye; ſo that I am apt to think, that the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of white Bodies may as well be convex, as ſmooth, provided the Superficies be ſo ſet with
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:59609:542"/>Specular Particles, as to reflect the Rays of Light plentifully upon the Eye; for it is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerv'd, that the globular Particles of Oyl, make the Water they are mix'd with appear White; but the ſame Colour is likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected, from Powdered Glaſs, and even ſeveral Threds of it laid together; ſo that it is not, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Opinion of ſome, requiſite that the Particles of a white Body, ſhould be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether Globular. And I have obſerv'd, that Snow look'd upon, with a Microſcope, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to conſiſt of ſlender Icicles of ſeveral ſhapes. And I remember, that by contuſion, I have obtained a whitiſh Powder of Granates, Glaſs of Antimony, and Emeralds; and the Salt of Venereal Vitriol, Powdered, will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively with the Entire Chryſtals, exhibit a conſiderable Degree of Whiteneſs.</p>
                     <p>And as a Body which is not White, may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that Colour, by a Change of the Texture of its Parts; ſo one that is White, may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of that Colour: Thus Silver being firſt bruſh'd, and then boyled with Salt and Tartar appears White; but becomes Specular by being rubb'd with a Piece of Steel, the protuberant Parts, being by that means depreſs'd into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd Superficies, and reflecting the Image of a lucid Body, whereas before the innumerable lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Speculae</hi> reflected the Rays of Light more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly.</p>

                           </gap> of Blackneſs.</note>From what hath been ſaid of Whiteneſs, we may be able to gueſs in ſome Meaſure of the Reaſon of Blackneſs, concerning which Quality <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> ſays, <hi>Exiſtimare par est, corpora ſuapte natura nigra constare ex particulis, quarum Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cicculae
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:59609:542"/>ſcabrae ſunt, nec facilè lucem extrorſum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flectunt:</hi> So that Black differs from White, in as much as the Particles which are reflected ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally by the one, are deaded by the other, and not reflected outward, either becauſe the Superficies hath ſuch protuberant Parts, as reflect the Rays internally, or being ſoft and pliable yield to the Impreſs of thoſe lucid Parts that ſtrike againſt them; ſo a Ball, that would fly back from a Stone, will ſcarce at all Rebound from a Net or Mud; tho' the latter Explication I think the leſs propable, becauſe ſeveral Bodies are Black, whoſe Surfaces are ſcarce of ſo yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Texture, except their peculiar Texture would render them more capable of being worked on, by the Rays of Light, than other Bodies, otherwiſe ſofter than they.</p>
                     <p>But whatever is the Cauſe, why the Beams of Light are very ſparingly reflected from Opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous Bodies; that that is the Reaſon of Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will be rendred probable if we take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that if a black Subſtance be held partly in the Sun-ſhine, and partly out, that Part will appear Blackeſt, which is leaſt Shone upon; and if the rough Surface of a black Marble be well Poliſh'd, and brought to the Form of a Concave <hi>Speculum,</hi> it will repreſent the Image of the Sun without dazling the Eyes, and will not in a long time ſet Wood on Fire, tho' a leſs <hi>Speculum</hi> of Matter of a more reflecting Nature would cauſe it to Flame in a Trice.</p>
                     <p>And to this I ſhall add, that having ſet a white and a black Marble Mortar in the Sun, the Black one collected the Rays of the Sun, ſo as to form a Focus much more conſpicuous
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:59609:543"/>and hot than the other, by which they were more diſpers'd, and reflected a glaring Light. And the Beams of a Candle being caſt upon two Pieces of Marble, through a round Hole, half an Inch <hi>Diameter,</hi> the Circle of Light on the Black one, tho much leſs Luminous, was better Defin'd.</p>
                     <p>And for a further Confirmation of our Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, I ſhall add, that when the Rays of Light, fall on the Holes in linnen Cloth, or the Mouth of a Well, thoſe Parts are much Darker, the Beams of Light being not reflected back upon the Eye; And even black Velvet, being ſtroak'd up and down, ſeem'd much Blacker one way than the other, the ſilken Piles when inclin'd, reflecting a greater Number of Rays to the Eye, than the Tops of them were able to do, which make but a ſmall Part of the Superficies: And I have obſerv'd, that a Cart-load of Carrots, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd much more Dark when the Ends of them were towards me, than when a greater Number of Rays were reflected to the Eye by the ſides of them. And in a dark Room it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, that if the Light falls upon a black Cloth, the reflection from it is not near ſo ſenſible as if a White one be employ'd.</p>
                     <p>And I have obſerv'd, that a Piece of Tile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing partly colour'd Black, and partly White, the Red was much hotter than the White, tho' not ſo hot as the Black Part: And it hath been obſerv'd in <hi>Italy,</hi> that black Marbles expos'd to the Sun were much hotter than White ones, tho' it is obſerv'd, that the black Marble is much more ſolid than White. And it is further obſerv'd, that Rooms hung with Black are
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:59609:543"/>much warmer than others, ſo that a Lady who was of a Tender Conſtitution was us'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that ſhe was apt to take Cold, after ſhe had viſited Perſons whoſe Rooms where hung with Black. And I am told, that in hot Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, Eggs colour'd Black, and expos'd to the Sun, would be roaſted by it. And I have obſerv'd them in <hi>England</hi> to acquire a conſiderable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Heat by being expos'd to the Sun in the Summer-time Blacken'd over.</p>
                     <p>And not only the blind <hi>Dutch-man,</hi> but as <hi>Bartholinus</hi> ſays, a blind Earl of <hi>Mansfield</hi> could diſtinguiſh White from Black by the Rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the latter.</p>
                     <p>And for theſe Reaſons I am the rather inclin'd to believe the Doctrine propos'd, leaving it to be determin'd by experience, whether the Beams of Light be reflected from opacous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and ſo differently modified before they reach the Eye, or whether from white Bodies they are not mov'd more briskly.</p>

                        <p>IF a Solution of Vitriol be ſhaken with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Galls diluted with Water, it will turn it Black; but by an addition of a few drops of Oyl of Vitriol, it will preſently lay down it's dark Colour and become Tranſparent; but upon an addition of Salt of Tartar diſſolv'd, it will again acquire a Blackneſs; and tho' this Ink be pale, yet when Dry, it is very Black. The like ſucceeded with common Ink, but not ſo eaſily, the Operation of the Salts being hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by the Gum. And here I ſhall take Notice, that tho it be generally allow'd, that alkalizate Salts will not precipitate Bodies, except firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd in ſome <hi>Acid Menstruum;</hi> Yet I have try'd, that a <hi>Lixivium</hi> of Pot-aſhes, being pour'd upon Decoctions of Vegetables, would precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate a curdled Matter, which would be left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind in the Filtre. And in making the firſt Ink, ſeveral Particles of black Matter, would be ſeperated by a Filtre; and when the Ink was made Clear again by the Oyl of Vitriol, the Salt of Tarter ſeem'd to precipitate and to unite
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:59609:544"/>thoſe Particles of Matter which were diſſolv'd by the corroſive Oyl.</p>
                        <p>And to ſhew, that Galls are not ſo requiſite to the making of Ink, as they are generally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, I added a few Drops of a Solution of Vitriol, to a Decoction of Roſe Leaves, upon which it turn'd black, and changed that Colour for a deep Red, when <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> was added to it, which was reduc'd to a Black again by Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Urine. And tho' upon a Mixture of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, mention'd in the Second Chapter of this Hiſtory of Colours, a black Colour immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly emerges, yet both the Infuſion of <hi>Orpiment</hi> and a Solution of <hi>Minium</hi> were before they were mix'd, limpid and Colourſes.</p>

<pb n="475" facs="tcp:59609:546"/>and Hares as well as other Animals, I ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn ſome Collections I have made for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And firſt, tho it is believ'd, that the Blackneſs of the Skins of <hi>Negroes</hi> depends on the Heat of the Sun, which in other hot Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries is obſerv'd to darken the Complexions of Men, more than in <hi>England;</hi> yet I am apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that ſomething elſe is requiſite to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of thoſe Colours, beſides the Influence of the Sun, ſince we ſee that Infants are of the ſame Colour. Beſides, in other Places of the ſame Latitude, the People are obſerv'd to be at the moſt but Tawny; and ſeveral Nations in the Empire of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> ſituated almoſt under the <hi>Torrid Zone:</hi> And it is obſerv'd by Travellers and Navigators, that there are very few Blacks in <hi>America,</hi> tho' the New World contains ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Climates, and reaches from one Tropick to another. And tho' the <hi>Danes</hi> are whiter than the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> yet it is obſerv'd, that the <hi>Swedes</hi> who likewiſe Inhabit thoſe cold Countries are not ſo white as them. And I have ſeen ſeveral <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> who were of a much browner Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion than the <hi>Danes,</hi> tho' theſe are ſaid to proceed from a Race of <hi>Tartars,</hi> for in one Province the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> are obſerv'd to be much whiter. And I am told, that <hi>Negroes</hi> live not far from the <hi>Cape of good Hope,</hi> which is beyond the <hi>Southern</hi> Tropick, tho' near the ſame degree of Latitude <hi>Northward,</hi> Divers <hi>American</hi> Nations are not inhabited by <hi>Negroes,</hi> and the Inhabitants of <hi>Candia,</hi> ſome Parts of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and even <hi>Spain</hi> are not ſo much as <hi>Tawny Moors.</hi> And even the Inhabitants of <hi>Greenland</hi> are obſerv'd to be of an Olive-colour, or a darker Complexion.</p>

                        <p>But nevertheleſs, that Coldneſs may in ſome meaſure contribute to Blackneſs or Whiteneſs, appears from what hath been obſerv'd in <hi>Ruſſia</hi> and <hi>Livonia, viz.</hi> that Hares and Foxes become white in Winter, and regain their genuine Colours again in the Summer; yet in <hi>Curland,</hi> as <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> relates, they vary not their Colour in the Winter; tho' this Country is only ſeverv'd from <hi>Livonia</hi> by the River <hi>Dugna,</hi> where it may ſeem too ſtrange to be credited, that ſo ſmall a compaſs as that River takes up, ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity the Effects of Cold ſo much; and the ſame Objection may be made in reſpect of the <hi>Moors,</hi> ſince <hi>Negroes</hi> inhabit on one ſide the River <hi>Cenega,</hi> and Tawny colour'd People on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                        <p>Another Opinion concerning the Colour of <hi>Negroes</hi> is, that it was a Curſe entail'd upon the Race of <hi>Cham.</hi> But not to ſhift off the natural Cauſe of that Colour, by flying to a Principal and Univerſal Cauſe, whilſt there is no neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it; not to urge, that the Curſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by <hi>Noah,</hi> was, that he ſhould be a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Servants, which was fulfill'd, when the Poſterity of <hi>Sem</hi> ſubdued the <hi>Cananites;</hi> I ſee not why Blackneſs ſhould be eſteem'd a Curſe, ſince the <hi>Negroes</hi> are ſo much content with it, that they paint the Devil white: Nor do I think Blackneſs inconſiſtent with Beauty, ſince it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in a Sumetry of Parts and good Features in the Face; ſo that Blackneſs cannot reaſonably be accounted a Curſe, except that Colour cauſes their Bodies to be more ſcorched by the heat of the Sun, than if it were white, according to the Doctrine above deliver'd.</p>

                        <p>But I am rather inclin'd to think, that they proceed from ſome ſeminal Influence, ſince <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes,</hi> as well as <hi>Americans</hi> Tranſplanted, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Proper and Native Colours; and Twins which are got by the <hi>Portugals</hi> and <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Women, are, ſometimes, one of them white, and the other black. And how far ſeminal Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions contribute to the differences of Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Parts, appears from the flat Noſes, and Blubber Lips of moſt <hi>Negroes.</hi> To which may be added, the little Feet of the <hi>Chineſes</hi> and the <hi>Macrocephali</hi> mention'd by <hi>Hypocrates.</hi> And it hath not only been obſerv'd, that a ſort of Hens want Rumps; but I have ſeen a Raven perfectly white. To which I ſhall add, that a Lady, who was a devout Catholick, looking upon the Peb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles at the Bottom of St. <hi>Winifred</hi>'s Well, ſome time after bore a Child whoſe Skin was cover'd with the Reſemblance of Red Pebbles.</p>
                        <p>To what hath been ſaid of <hi>Negroes,</hi> I ſhall add, that the <hi>Epidermis</hi> only is black, the Skin under that, being as white as that of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans;</hi> ſo that a Child who had the Meaſles or ſmall Pox, after thoſe Pimples had broke, was cover'd with a multitude of white Spots: And it is atteſted by ſeveral, that the <hi>Negroes</hi> when firſt born, are red or white like other Children, but in a few days acquire the Colour of their Parents: Nevertheleſs, ſome of them that are born under the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> continue white, and are preſented to the King, and always wait on him.

And black mineral Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony may, by the Salts which concur to the Compoſition of Sublimate, be turn'd into a rectify'd Butter of Antimony, which upon an Affuſion of fair Water, will precipitate the white Powder call'd <hi>Mercurius Vitae;</hi> and the like Powder may be made of Antimony without any Addition at all: And the like white Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance will be precipitated by an Affuſion of Water, upon a Solution of ſulphureous Gums in Spirit of Wine.

And I have ſometimes turn'd black Pieces of Silk, yellow, with Oyl of Vitriol. And as for Whiteneſs, we ought not to believe it ſo eaſily deſtroy'd without Caution and ſome Reſtrictions: For Lead is by Calcination, turn'd into a red Body; and Tin is reduc'd into a white <hi>Calx,</hi> and the common Putty ſold in the Shops, is made up of half Tin and half Lead, and yet, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Lead, the Putty is white, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſcovering any Mixture of <hi>Minium.</hi> And ſo if Copper be mix'd by Fuſion with half the Quantity of Tin, they will yield a Subſtance,

And to ſhew how much the white Colour of a Metal may obſcure the Colour of thoſe it is mix'd with, I ſhall add, that a fourth Part of Gold being mix'd with Silver, the yellow Colour of the Gold was not to be diſcern'd; but when it was rubb'd on a Touch-ſtone, <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> would take off the Silver, and leave the Gold behind it, upon the Stone.</p>

                        <p>IT is Taught by the Chymiſts, that Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs depends on <hi>Sulphur aduſt.</hi> But beſides what hath been already offer'd as the cauſe of Blackneſs, I ſhall add, in reference to the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion here propos'd, that common <hi>Sulphur</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim'd, is far from black, but it is in a great meaſure yellow, and rather more than leſs white than before; and when ſet on fire to make <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leum Sulph. per campanam,</hi> it yields very little Soot; and the Flame yields ſo little, that it will ſcarce black a white Sheet of Paper; and it is obſerv'd rather to whiten than to black Linnen, and makes red Roſe Leaves grow pale and not black. And I have ſeen a Piece of fix'd Sulphur, which was kept ſeveral Weeks in a violent Heat, yet it had no other Colour when cool, but a pure red. And not only Sulphur, but that ſulphureous Body Camphire may be kept in a violent Heat without acquiring any thing of Blackneſs: Nor will inflammable Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine, diſcolour a piece of Paper held o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it whilſt it conſumes. And Tin calein'd, yields not a black, but a white <hi>Calx;</hi> and not only the Charcoal made of <hi>Oxy-Cedar</hi> is white, but the Smoak of <hi>Tinby</hi> Coals is obſerv'd rather to blanch Linnen than black it: To what hath been ſaid we may add, that the Ingredients of our Ink were not hot but cold; and Juice of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons will blacken the Blade of Knife, except it be quickly wiped off, tho' no actual Heat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervenes to aduſt the Sulphur. And if the Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:59609:551"/>of the Ink depended on aduſt Sulphur, it might be demanded, what became of thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſt Particles, when the Liquor, by a few drops of Oyl of Vitriol, loſt that Colour. Beſides, Soot it ſelf may have it's Texture ſo far alter'd, as to yield a Cryſtalline Salt and a tranſparent Colour.</p>
                        <p>But were it allow'd, ſince Aduſtion renders ſome Bodies black, that that Colour depended on a trorrify'd Sulphur, it might be further demanded, what gives torrify'd Sulphur that Colour; and it might be queſtion'd, what makes a Window half ſhut, at a diſtance to appear black, ſince it hath no Acceſs of torrify'd Sulphur upon that Poſture, but only the Rays of Light are not ſo plentiflly reflected by it, as is requiſite to affect the Senſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with a more lively Colour; But to conclude. What the Chymiſts teach of Blackneſs, to me ſeems to come to no more, than if in anſwer to an Enquiry after the Cauſe of Salivation, they ſhould tell us, that the ſeveral kinds of Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of Gold and Mercury, and likewiſe of Quickſilver and Silver ſalivate upon Account of the <hi>Mercury</hi> that abounds in them, where we are ſtill at a loſs to know why <hi>Mercury</hi> ſhould have that Effect.</p>

To which I ſhall add, that the moſt part of the Priſm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cover'd with an opacous Body, ſo that, the Rays falling but on a ſmall Part of it, the <hi>Iris</hi> was but little, yet the Colour appear'd to be the ſame through a Microſcope as to the naked Eye.</p>

                        <p>I Am told that <hi>Lignum Nephriticum</hi> is us'd in the Country where it grows as an excellent Medicine againſt the Stone; which Virtues <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardes</hi> likewiſe aſcribes to it given in Infuſion. An Infuſion of this Wood, if it be not too ſtrong will appear, betwixt the Eye and the Light, to be of a golden Colour, except that upon the Top it will be cover'd with a sky Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd Circle; but if your Eye be plac'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Window and the Vial, the Liquor will appear to be of a lovely Blew. And this Experiment hath ſucceeded by Candle Light: If the Liquor be held partly before the Eye and a Light, and partly betwixt the Eye and an Opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous Body, it will half of it ſeem of a golden Colour, and half a Blew; but if turning your back on the Window you obſerve the Liquor as it is poured out, it will at the firſt ſeem Blew; but when it hath fallen lower, and the Rays of Light penetrate it more, it will ſeem Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couloured. If a little of this Tincture be pour'd into a Baſin of Water, partly in the Sun Beams and partly ſhaded, it will afford ſeveral pleaſing <hi>Phaenomena.</hi> If ſome of it be pour'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on white Paper, the drops about it will appear of different Colours, as the Poſition of the Eye in reference to them varies; and when it is pour'd off, the Paper will be dyed Yellow; and
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:59609:555"/>if this be plac'd in a Window in the Sun-ſhine, and a Pen held betwixt the Sun and part of the Paper, the Verge of the Shadow next the Body that Cauſes it will be Golden, and the other Blew. Which <hi>Phenomena</hi> proceeded from the moſt ſubtile Parts of the Wood Swimming in the Water, and in ſeveral Poſitions variouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting the Rays of Light. Some of this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor being carefully Diſtill'd, it yielded a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourleſs Limpid Water, a deep ceruleous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor remaining behind. Spirit of Wine and Salt of Harts-horn, being mixed together I obſerv'd, that it required a certain proportion betwixt the Liquor and the Salt, which enabl'd it to vary it's Colour. So that tho I was induc'd to believe that our Tincture receiv'd its Colour from a Salt diſpers'd through it, yet I ſuſpected, that this Salt would be either alter'd or incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated by Acid Salts; and accordingly drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Spirit of Vinegar into ſome of the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture it loſt its Blew, but not the Golden Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; but upon an Affuſion of Oyl of <hi>Tartar per deliquium,</hi> that correcting the Acid Salts, it preſently regain'd its Blew Colour again, the ponderous Tartarous Liquor firſt altering the Bottom of the Liquor and gradually riſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>

<pb n="490" facs="tcp:59609:556"/>ſince he calls it a white <hi>Mexican</hi> Wood, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ours, as <hi>Monardes</hi> witneſſes is brought from <hi>Nova Hiſpania,</hi> and is not of a White, but a darker Colour, except on the outſide, which part is much weaker than the other. Beſides, he tells us that his Tincture was like Spring Water when held betwixt the Light, whereas ours is Yellowiſh or Reddiſh, as the Tincture is wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker or ſtronger. And ſince he tells us, that the Tincture will afford all ſorts of Colours, and reſume a ceruleous Colour in the Dark, I could wiſh to know how he was convinc'd of the Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and as for the Former, I have tryed that it would not at all Anſwer. Tho' this I muſt needs own, that having held a Tincture of <hi>Lignum Nephriticum</hi> in the Rays of the Sun, in a darken'd Room, partly in and partly out, and alſo, wholly out of the Beams but partly near them, it afforded a much greater Variety of Colours than in a lighten'd Room.</p>
                        <p>In this Experiment it is not a little to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd, that the Blew Colour ſhould be ſo eaſily deſtroy'd, whereas the Yellow Colour is ſo du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; and further, that Acid Salts ſhould deſtroy it and Sulphureous one Reſtore it.</p>

A Yellow ſolution of Gold in <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> being mix'd with a blew Solution of crude Copper by ſhaking yielded a tranſparent Green: And ſo did blew and yellow Amel melted together: Whether this compound Colour proceeds from a Union of Rays, or elſe from the joint Effect they have upon the Retina, as when two Strings ſound at the ſame time they make one united Sound I ſhall not now ſtay to Examine; but ſhall briefly intimate that by a good Microſcope I
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:59609:558"/>could diſcern each of the Powders of the Biſe and Orpiment Diſtinct, ſo that a Tranſpoſition and Juxtapoſition of Parts may produce a new Colour, by variouſly modifying and reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Rays of Light that fall upon them.

                        <p>ONE thing to be obſerv'd in the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments above recited is, that tho' the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours mention'd, are eaſily produc'd; yet ſome of them preſently fade, by the Influence of the Air, or the Inteſtine Motion of their own Parts. And <hi>Parkiſon</hi> tells us, that Berries of that Plant, which bears <hi>Turnſol,</hi> a Pigment well known in Painters Shops, when they are at their full Maturity, yield a Juice, which being rubb'd upon Paper appears green, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently degenerates into a blewiſh Purple, upon the Cloth or Paper; and theſe being wet in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and wrung forth, will give it a Claret Colour. And I have obſerv'd the Red Colour of Buckthorn Berries degenerate into a dirty Grey Colour; yet by the Mixture of an Alkaly or an Acid it would put on a green or red Colour; and the ſame Succeſs we had when we dropp'd the ſame Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor upon a Piece of glaz'd Tile. And I have obſerv'd, that Silver precipitated in <hi>Aq. Fortis,</hi> tho' at the firſt it is white, yet when upon a

And I have ſeen a ſort of Pears, which would give a red Tincture to Wine. And it is obſerv'd, that Spirit of Wine being kept upon white Salt of Tartar, acquires a red Tincture.

                        <p>SALT diſtill'd, at a certain time of the Operation yields red Fumes; and Vitriol, tho green or blew, comes over in white Fumes; and the like I have obſerv'd in the Fumes of ſeveral other Concretes.

Yet red Roſe Leaves being put in warm Water, Oyl of Vitriol extracted a red Tincture, but Oyl of Tartar would not. But we obſerv'd, that the Oyl of Tartar only haſten'd the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the <hi>Senna,</hi> ſince the Leaves in a Nights time will yield a Tincture in cold Water, which will not be heighten'd by Salt of Tartar. And it may be ſaid of the red Roſe Leaves, that the Tincture was rather extracted than produc'd by the Oyl: Yet this is obſervable, that in extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Tinctures, the one will not do what the other will; but I have found that <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> will do as well as Oyl of Vitriol.</p>
                        <p>If upon the red Tincture of Roſes decanted, you drop Spirit of Urine, and ſhake the Viol it is contain'd in, it will acquire a greeniſh Blew; which is obſervable, ſince the turning of red into blew is a very unfrequent Obſervation. And in the Paſſage of this red Tincture to a blew, if it be taken as the Liquor is dropp'n in, it will afford a pretty variety of Colours, ſo as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to repreſent the Tincture of <hi>Lignum Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phriticum.</hi> And if the Tincture be very high, the Spirit of Urine will turn it to a deep Opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous blew; but the Liquor being left open two or three Days, both the blew and the red Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour vaniſh'd; the Liquor being of an Amber Colour, and having a feculent Sediment of the ſame Colour, which ſeems to be form'd of the
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:59609:564"/>Roſes drawn together by the Acid, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated by the Volatile Salt of the Spirit of Urine, in whoſe room other ſulphureous Salts may be ſubſtituted. And on this occaſion I ſhall add, That</p>
                        <p>Having dropp'd Spirit of Urine into an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Galls, it preſently turn'd the Red Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor into a Purple one; but if the Infuſion of Logwood were impregnated with acid Spirits of Salt, it would yield neither a Red nor a Purple, but a yellow Liquor.</p>

                        <p>TO ſhew that Colours may be generated <hi>de novo,</hi> and again deſtroy'd; We dropp'd Oyl of Tartar into a Solution of Sublimate in Water, and the Liquor being agitated, it was turn'd into a deep Orange Colour; but upon dropping in ſome Drops of Oyl of Vitriol, and continuing to ſhake the Glaſs ſtrongly, the whole will preſently become tranſparent again. In which the Colour reſults from a Coalition of the Mercurial Particles with the ſaline ones, and with the Alkalizate Particles of the Salt of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, which ſwim up and down in the Oyl: But how theſe uniting come to form ſuch a Subſtance as reflects ſuch a Colour, I confeſs my ſelf at a loſs to explain. But in Confirmation of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I have given for the Colour of this Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate; I ſhall add, that having ſublimed together equal Parts of <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> and Sublimate, and diſſolv'd the aſcending Flowers in Water, and ſiltred it, the limpid Liquor turn'd white upon the Affuſion of an Alkaly, and not yellow.
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:59609:564"/>And not only by altering the Texture of the Mercury, but by varying the precipitating Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, the Succeſs of the Experiment will be different: For if Spirit of Urine be made uſe of inſtead of Salt of Tartar, the Precipitate will be of a different Colour from the former. And from Quickſilver it ſelf, without Sublimate, we may prepare a Pricipitate, diſſoluble in Water without diſcolouring it. And the Colour of ſuch Subſtances ſo much depends on the Texture of the Parts concurring to the Compoſition, that tho' in our Experiment, Oyl of Vitriol de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the yellow Colour; yet by the Aſſiſtance of Oyl of Vitriol, we may make a yellow Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate, with Quickſilver and Water alone. And I the rather employ Oyl of Vitriol in ſuch Experiments, becauſe it is not only void of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, but ſtrong and inciſive; for notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing common and undephlegmed <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> will not effect the ſame thing; yet being carefully dephlegmed, it will in ſome meaſure anſwer Expectation. But one thing to be noted in this Experiment, is, That tho' by dropping in Oyl of Tartar and Oyl of Vitriol ſucceſſively, the Liquor will regain and loſe it's yellow Colour, yet the Proportion of the Liquor growing leſs in reſpect of the ſucceſſive additional Drops, the yellow Colour will gradually appear more faint.</p>

                           <p>If Crude Antimony be boil'd in a ſtrong <hi>Lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium,</hi> it will yield a ſulphureous Sediment, which will ſettle in yellow Flakes in the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:59609:565"/>and will be more apt to take fire than the Powder of Antimony. Therefore conſidering that Sulphur boil'd in a <hi>Lixivium,</hi> may be precipitated by Rheniſh or white Wine; and likewiſe that by Acids I could precipitate other ſulphureous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes out of lixiviate Solvents, ſuch as crude Antimony; And tho' common Sulphur yields a white Precipitate call'd <hi>Lac Sulphuris;</hi> yet I concluded that Antimony would yield a yellow one, as well by being made by Oyl of Vitriol, as Length of time. Wherefore I put a freſh Solution of Antimony into one Glaſs, and ſome of the Orange colour'd Mixture into another, where by dropping Oyl of Vitriol into the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it would become tranſparent, whereas the ſame Oyl would turn the other clear Solution in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a deep Yellow.

<pb n="509" facs="tcp:59609:565"/>the Alkaly ſeparating, and retaining the Sea-Salt mix'd with it; for it would not only turn Syrup of Violets green, and Verdigreaſe Azure, but would precipitate a White Subſtance from a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Sublimate.

I found that Spirit of Oak, tho' it be a Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Principle, yet it would turn Syrup of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets Purple, and deſtroy the Blewneſs of a Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of <hi>Lignum Nephritium,</hi> as Acids do, and would corrode Coral like Spirit of Vinegar; but when the Acid Part of this Spirit was ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the other, it would have no more Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon any of thoſe Liquors as Spirit of Wine or Eſſential Oyls. And by this Method we may diſcover the Nature of moſt Salts produced ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Art or Nature; And by the ſame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod here laid down I have obſerv'd, ſeveral Liquors, which, tho' run <hi>per Deliquium,</hi> would have no other Effect than Spirit of Wine. And I know how to make a ſtrong ſaline Body, which will neither Work upon Syrup of Violets, or a Solution of Sublimate. And now to what I have ſaid, it may be ſeaſonable to add, that the Effects of Salts upon a Solution of Sublimate depend on the peculiar Texture, not only of the Solution, but of the Bodies by which it is precipitated; for a Solution of Gold in <hi>Aqua Regia</hi> will yield a yellow Precipitate, whether Oyl of Tartar, Spirit of Urine or <hi>Sal Armoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack</hi>
                              <pb n="510" facs="tcp:59609:566"/>be added to it; yet Oyl of Vitriol, which precipitates a Solution of Silver in <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> will have no ſuch Effect. And the Cryſtals of Silver diſſolv'd, will yield a White Precipitate; whether an Alkaly, or an Acid. was dropp'd into the Solution, yet <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> would not produce the like Effect: So that the Superfluous Moiſture being evaporated, the metalline Corpuſeles with the ſaline ones that had imbib'd them, coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Salt, as ſuch Solutions uſually do, when the Metal hath been precipitated.</p>

<pb n="517" facs="tcp:59609:570"/>attributed to ſome Copper latent in the Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. And tho' Copper calcin'd <hi>per ſe</hi> yields a dark colour'd <hi>Calx,</hi> yet it tinges Glaſs Green; But being kept in Fuſion with 100 times it's Weight in Glaſs, it afforded not a green, but a blew Subſtance, which whether it proceeded from the Action of the Mineral, or it's ſaline Parts only, or both, I muſt not ſtay to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. But to proceed, Putty made of Tin and Lead Calcin'd together, being a white <hi>Calx</hi> gives colliquated Glaſs the reſemblance of white Amel, which will receive into it the Colours of divers Minerals which will indure the Fire: And I have elſewhere taken Notice, that blew and yellow Amel, being compounded will afford a Green. And it is commonly known that the dark Subſtance call'd <hi>Zaffora</hi> will give Glaſs a blew Tincture. And that dark Subſtance term'd <hi>Magneſia</hi> from it's ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Colour to that of a Load-ſtone, gives Glaſs not only Colours different from its own, but in themſelves; as a Red, Purpliſh or Blackiſh, as the Quantity of it varies; yet it is us'd to free Glaſs from that blewiſh green Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour that it is ſubject to; and this may ſerve to confirm what we deliver'd in the XLIV Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, <hi>viz.</hi> that as the Parts of a Pigment are more cloſely or ſet at diſtance, the Colour will vary.

<pb n="521" facs="tcp:59609:572"/>from a Liquor, when it is in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure yielded by the Solution of Allom made uſe of to precipitate it.</p>
                           <p>The abovemention'd way of making Lakes, being try'd with Madder, it yielded a Red one, and with Rue, it afforded one of the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour with the Leaves. But ſince the Colour is extracted from the Vegetable by the addition of a <hi>Lixivium,</hi> it is a Queſtion, whether the Lake will always be of the Colour of the Herb, ſince <hi>Lixiviate</hi> Salts may not only extract, but alter the Tinctures of Vegetables. And tho', Acids ſometimes do, yet we have found by experience, that they will not always reſtore Colours deſtroy'd by Alkalies, ſince Syrup of Violets turn'd Green by an Alkaly, will not be reſtor'd to a Blew by an Acid, but is chang'd to a Red. And I have found, that when the Colour of the Lake was not alter'd by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaly, it would be much fainter than the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable it was drawn from. But to conclude this Experiment, I ſhall add, that Allom is not only of uſe in ſuch like Experiments as theſe; but alſo in the Dyers Trade.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>HAving a Mind not only to change the Colour of one Body into another, but alſo to obtain two Subſtances of diſtinct Colours from one Body; in order to it I conſider'd, that ſince Spirit of Vinegar wholly loſes it's Acidity by work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon <hi>Minium,</hi> the Solution would alter the Juices of Plants, as Oyl of Tartar uſually does,
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:59609:573"/>and acordingly I found that it turn'd, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of red Roſe Leaves Green. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſidering, that Oyl of Vitriol will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate Solutions of Minerals, eſpecially in Spirit of Vinegar, and that the Calcesare uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fair and White:</p>
                        <p>Conſidering theſe things, I dropp'd a Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Minium</hi> into an Infuſion of Roſes, by which it was turn'd Green; but dropping on that, Oyl of Vitriol, it would precipitate the Lead in the form of a white Powder, and leave in the Liquor a clear and high Tincture of Roſes, which appear'd when the Experiment was try'd in a Glaſs ſhap'd like an inverted Cone. And this Experiment likewiſe ſucceeded, when Spirit of Salt was made uſe of inſtead of Oyl of Vitriol; but with <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> it would not ſucceed; for tho' that Liquor will heighten the Colour of the Tincture of Roſes, yet it will not precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Lead.</p>
                        <p>And as by this means from a Green we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a white and red colour'd Subſtance, ſo a Purple will yield a yellow and a red Liquor; for if inſtead of an Alkaly, which turns an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Logwood Purple, I made uſe of a Solution of <hi>Minium,</hi> and put one Part of this to two of the Infuſion, Spirit of Salt would precipitate a red Subſtance and leave the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor above Yellow. But an Infuſion of Log<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood being turn'd Purple by a Mixture of a Solution of <hi>Minium,</hi> Spirit <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped upon them, precipitated a Blewiſh deep Purple Subſtance, partly in the form of a Powder and partly Curdl'd; but upon an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spirit of Salt the remaining Part of
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:59609:573"/>the Lead was precipitated in the form of a white Powder; ſo that there were in the Glaſs three diſtinct Colours, <hi>viz,</hi> a Purple at the bottom, a white Carnation upon that, and upon the top a tranſparent Liquor, Yellow or Red.</p>
                        <p>But to conclude, I ſhall add that I would not have my Readers too haſtily to think, any of the foregoing Experiments falſe, tho' they ſhould not ſucceed upon firſt Tryal, ſince very ſlight Circumſtances may alter or fruſtrate the Event of ſeveral of them; to Confirm which I ſhall add the following Inſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> that if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients made uſe of to dye Scarlet, be weighed and mix'd never ſo exactly, and all other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances be obſerv'd; yet if they are not boyled in a Veſſel lin'd with Tin, the Cochineel will not be able to ſtrike a right Colour.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:59609:583"/>and Prudence contribute to the well Governing of a People, who are the more diſpoſed to be Loyal and Good Subjects, the more by Example you promote Religion, which teaches them to obey: Upon which Account we may truly ſay, that You act not the Politician, but, what is much more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, like a Wiſe and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent States-Man; You gain the People not by Stratagem, but Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>

                  <p>But not to enlarge too much on a Subject which the World is ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb facs="tcp:59609:584"/>with, I ſhall need to ſay no more, than that in Your Illuſtrious Perſon we may ſee all the juſt Qualifications of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobleman concentered; ſince your Honour is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported not only by Titles, but Actions; ſo that Your Character is pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted, in a World ready to take the leaſt occaſion of Calumny and Aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, The Second Volume conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with thoſe Subjects which are more immediately the Objects of our Senſes, <hi>viz.</hi> Taſtes, Odours, and Colours, this Third begins with what our Author hath ſaid in Relation to Cold and Heat; to which is added, what he hath delivered concerning Fire and Flame, and thoſe Bodies which chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affect our Sight. And as for the remaining Part of the Book, it will be ſo evident to the Reader, that the Subjects bear a Relation one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oher, that there is no need I ſhould alledge any thing elſe to ſuggeſt why I placed them in that Order.</p>
                  <p>And now having thus far at the laſt performed a Task which hath been ſo long deſired, and which hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been ſo well accepted by the Learned; it would be Ingratitude in me not to return them Thanks, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb facs="tcp:59609:586"/>ſo candidly the Labours of one who values himſelf upon nothing more than that he hath had the opportunity of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing away his Time in their Service, and in contributing his Endeavours in a Work that may be uſeful in promoting Natural Knowledge: To do which, is not only the Study, but the Diverſion of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Reader's very Humble Servant,</p>

                     <salute>Candid Reader.</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>ALthough it is the General Conſent of all Learned Men, that the Author<hi>'s</hi> Works deſerve the higheſt Eſteem amongſt all Cultivators of Natural Knowledge; yet, it is as common a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint that long Apologies and too frequent Excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions interſpers'd through his Writings make 'em leſs ſerviceable to Vulgar Readers, who are una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to carry his Senſe along with them, when inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapted too often with Digreſſions, which have little or no Relation to the Subject under Conſideration.</p>
                  <p>And as his Prolix and Complaiſant Way of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is ſome Diſadvantage to Vulgar Readers; ſo there are ſome, who, tho' they have Abilities ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to extract the Inſtructive Part, and to paſs over his Prolixities, without loſing the Advantage of his Improvements; yet they are not backwards to ſay, that the Reading of Compliments takes up too much time, and they had rather have the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Part, without his long digreſſive Excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſince Men, deſirous of Knowledge, and leſs ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious of Compliments, need no Apologies to render Knowledge Acceptable, it being ſufficiently recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to Inquiſitive Readers by its own Uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>The Conſideration of this made me more willing to be concern'd in a Work, likely to be uſeful to
<pb facs="tcp:59609:589" rendition="simple:additions"/>vulgar Readers, and Acceptable to All; being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous and ready, to take any Opportunity of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing my Willingneſs to do any thing, that may oblige the Learned World, or tend to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Knowledg.</p>
                  <p>For tho' it is not to be deny'd, but that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments are great Ornaments and Arguments of the Candor of a well accompliſh'd Author; yet, it is to be allow'd, that, as too many of the fineſt Flowers may as well intercept the Light of the Sun, as an obſcure Cloud, ſo Compliments may prejudice Knowledge if too frequent, as ſoon as entertaining Digreſſions.</p>
                  <p>And if Digreſſions of any kind be of Diſſervice to the Reader, and conſequently Diſadvantagious to the Author, it will be the more acceptable Work, if whilſt I endeavour to gratifie the Reader, I become ſerviceable to the Author, in diſperſing thoſe Clouds; which, tho' they may ſeem Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men-like Embelliſhments, are not ſo entertaining to Philoſophers, who conſider things juſt as they are without Additions of Art or Rhetorick.</p>
                  <p>Having thus briefly given the Reader the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which induc'd me to the preſent Work, I ſhall in the next place proceed to give an Account of the Work it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, conſidering that the Author<hi>'s</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and Aim was not only to improve Knowledge, but, to uſe a <hi>Motto</hi> prefix'd to one of his Books from the Illuſtrious <hi>Verulam, Potiùs</hi> promovere <hi>in multis, quàm</hi> perficere <hi>in paucis;</hi> and ſince
<pb facs="tcp:59609:589"/>in order to a general intelligible <hi>Syſtem</hi> of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, he was ſollicitous of collecting as many <hi>Phaenomena</hi> as he could, and which might be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable in framing ſuch a <hi>Syſtem;</hi> ſo I have, (that the Author<hi>'s</hi> Aim and Deſign might not be prejudic'd by an Abſtract), taken Care both to Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomize thoſe things in which he might be ſaid <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficere,</hi> and likewiſe have taken Care not to omit the leaſt <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> which might contribute to the promoting of Natural Knowledge: So that I can juſtly ſay, there is nothing in the Author<hi>'s</hi> Works which is not in the Epitomy, except Digreſſions and Apologies.</p>
                  <p>And as I have taken Care to omit nothing, ſo I have been as ſollicitous to draw an Epitomy without any Enlargements, which the Nature of the Subjects did not require, or without contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more than the Subjects would admit.</p>
                  <p>And further, as where the Author has laid down ſeveral Hiſtorical Truths by way of Notes without Philoſophizing upon them, his Deſign being to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote as well as perfect, I have taken Care to avoid any other Connexion than the Author thought ſuch Notes requir'd, ſo I thought my ſelf oblig'd to give an Abſtract of the Author<hi>'s</hi> Philoſophical Thoughts, where he hath interſpers'd them with his Hiſtorical Truths, that the Work might be more perfect.</p>
                  <p>So that the Reader will have in the following Volume, which contains about <hi>30</hi> Sheets beſides the Cuts, as much Matter as in the Original takes
<pb facs="tcp:59609:590"/>up near <hi>200</hi> Sheets, which will not only carry this Advantage with it, that what before would have taken up near two Months time in reading, may be read in a Week, but he will likewiſe purchaſe Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy at ſo cheap a Rate, that upon that Account it will undoubtedly be more acceptable, the Price of this Volume coming far ſhort of Forty Shillings, which the Books Epitomiz'd in this Volume al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt amount to. But what is the greater Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage is, that ſo much Knowledge compris'd in ſo ſmall a Compaſs, will be more eaſily accquir'd by young Philoſophers, who in larger Volumes are apt to forget what they left at the Beginning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they arrive at the End of them: But by this Epitomy, a <hi>Syſtem</hi> of Philoſophy being brought, almoſt before the Eye at once, it will be more eaſily ſwallow'd and digeſted.</p>
                  <p>But whilſt I am conſidering the Advantages which the Reader will receive by the Abridgment, I am told by the Bookſellers, that it is likely to meet with ſome Diſadvantages upon another Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; for it being common for Buyers to eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the Value of a Book by the Bulk, they may think too great a Price put upon this Volume; And therefore, the Bookſellers think it neceſſary that I ſhould acquaint the Reader, that their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will take off that Objection; for beſides, the Dearneſs of Paper, and the Number of Cuts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in this Volume being ſo chargeable as to amount to a fourth Part of the Charges of the Book; it is hop'd that the Uſefulneſs of the Cuts
<pb facs="tcp:59609:590"/>will excuſe the Dearneſs of it; for to have Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Abridgment without 'em, would have made it dearer, tho' of a leſs Price, the Cuts being as requiſite to Illuſtrate the Author<hi>'s</hi> Works, as Maps in Geography to render Accounts of the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raqueous Globe more intelligible.</p>
                  <p>Thus much being ſaid in favour of the Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers, I ſhall now proceed to give a brief Account of the Method I have taken in this Volume, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving a further Account of the ſubſequent Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume till the Publication of it.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, conſidering that it is the uſual Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in <hi>Syſtems</hi> of Philoſophy, to begin with Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, and thence to proceed to Particulars; and likewiſe to lay down Principles in Order to Explain the ſeveral <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature by thoſe Principles; I have in compliance with ſo reaſonable a Method, firſt laid down the Doctrin of Forms and Qualities, and the Principles by which thoſe Qualities are diverſified, from whence likewiſe ariſe thoſe various Forms from whence each Particular Quality is deriv'd; and becauſe ſubordinate Forms depend on the ſame Principles, and differ only from ſimple or complex Forms in reference to their Union in Compound Bodies. I have likewiſe adjoyn'd an Account of them, which Doctrin of Forms and Qualities is further Illuſtrated by Experiments and Obſervations annex'd by our Author for that purpoſe: And becauſe there is an Affinity betwixt thoſe Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, and thoſe made by our Author on <hi>Salt-Petre,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:59609:591"/>to them I have annex'd an Abſtract of his Eſſay on <hi>Salt-Petre,</hi> which is not only a farther Illuſtration of the Doctrin of Forms and Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but being likewiſe of equal Force in Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating what he delivers concerning thoſe Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Affections of Matter, Fluidity and Firmneſs, I have in the next place laid down what he Teaches concerning thoſe more Catholick Modes of Matter; and ſince our Author in his Chapter of Fluidity hath likewiſe taken notice of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial Figures of Fluids, I have to that added what is delivered concerning the ſame Subject in the Philoſophical Tranſactions, and becauſe the Firmneſs of Bodies is ſaid to proceed from a Reſt in their Parts, I have ſubjoyn'd to that an Eſſay of the Motion of the Parts of Solids: And to conclude the firſt Book, which Treats of the most General Affections of Matter, I have added an Account of the Effects of Languid Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Propagableneſs of it through thoſe Catholick <hi>Mediums, viz.</hi> Fluids and Solids.</p>
                  <p>And theſe more Catholick <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being Explain'd in the first Book, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh 'em from Qualities more Particular; in the Second Book I begin with the Doctrin of Particular Qualities, which do not only depend on the Motion or Rest, Shape, Size and Texture of Matter, but likewiſe on the Structure of the World as now. Conſtituted, and the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as now Eſtabliſh'd.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe That Part of the Univerſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<pb facs="tcp:59609:591"/>in Our <hi>Vortex,</hi> is the Subject chiefly of the following Sheets, having first begun with an Introduction to Particular Qualities; I proceed to conſider, firſt the most General Obſervations in the Earthy Region, and from that proceed to conſider Submarine Regions, after which, by way of Introduction to the Region of the <hi>Air,</hi> I have added an Eſſay of the Natural and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural States of Bodies, and Particularly of the <hi>Air,</hi> from which proceeding to Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made in the <hi>Air,</hi> thoſe cloſing the first Volume; In the ſecond Volume I proceed to what he ſays further relating to the <hi>Air,</hi> in which I ſhall give a further Account of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod taken in that.</p>
                  <p>Having thus briefly given the Reader an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the following Method, I ſhall without detaining him any longer, ſubſcribe my ſelf the Candid Reader<hi>'s</hi>

                  <head>THE INTRODUCTION, Repreſenting the Grounds and Excellency of <hi>CORPUSCULAR PHILOSOPHI.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>HAVING in the <hi>Preface</hi> given the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> an Account of the following Sheets, I ſhall, by way of <hi>Introduction,</hi> repreſent the Grounds and Excellency of the <hi>Corpuſcular Philoſophy,</hi> as deliver'd by our Author.</p>
                  <p>And firſt: It hath this to recommend it above all other Syſtems of Philoſophy, That it teaches us not, as the Doctrin of the <hi>Epicureans</hi> does, that the World was made in an Infinite <hi>Vacuum,</hi> by a Caſual Concourſe of Atoms; nor as the <hi>Carteſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> That Matter, firſt put into Motion by <hi>GOD,</hi> convened into a World, as now conſtituted, by Laws Mechanical only; but it allows the <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent</hi> Creator a greater ſhare in the Works of his Hands, teaching that the Motions of the ſmall Parts of Matter, which compoſe the Univerſe, were guided by that Wiſe Architect, who when he had conſtituted the World, eſtabliſh'd the Laws of Nature. So that we only endeavour to explain thoſe as now conſtituted, and how they are Mechanically carry'd on.</p>
                  <p>In doing of which, it accounts for the ſeveral <hi>Phanomena</hi> of Nature, by Principles more intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible and clear, than the Doctrin of the <hi>Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teticks;</hi> ſince it is much more eaſily underſtood
<pb facs="tcp:59609:592"/>what I mean by Motion or Reſt, Size, Shape, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Situation, and a Contexture of the Parts of Matter, than by fanciful Ideas repreſented by the Doctrin of Privation, Subſtantial Forms, and their Eduction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor hath our <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> a leſs Advantage over the <hi>Hypoſtatical</hi> Principles of the <hi>Chymiſts,</hi> ſince it accounts for ſeveral <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> which they are at a loſs in; as Eclipſes of the Sun, which are brought on, and remov'd by a Local Motion of the Interfering Body, and thoſe others concern'd in the <hi>Phaenomenon:</hi> Or, to uſe another Inſtance, it is eaſily underſtood, that the Image of a Man caſt into the Air, by a Concave Spherical Looking-glaſs, are more Naturally accounted for by a Refraction of the Rays of Light than any <hi>Hypoſtatical</hi> Principles.</p>
                  <p>But beſides the Intelligibleneſs of our Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, it is a farther Recommendation, that none are more Primary than Matter and Motion; which is the firſt General Affection of it, nor can any be more ſimple: None more Primary, becauſe had the ſame Parts of Matter been always in the ſame Place, they could not be diverſify'd; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Motion was primarily neceſſary: Nor could any be more ſimple, becauſe neither could be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Parts of a different Denomination; ſince all Matter is equally Matter, and all Motion muſt bear the ſame Title, conſider'd barely as Motion.</p>
                  <p>And as none can be more Simple and Primary, ſo none can be more Comprehenſive; ſince Motion, Size, Figure, Order and Texture, may be diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd thouſands of ways; and as whole Libraries are made of Twenty-four Letters, ſo the ſeveral <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> of Nature may be explain'd by the ſeveral
<pb facs="tcp:59609:593"/>Varieties of Textures, and other Differences, ariſing from the various Changes our Principles are ſubject to.</p>
                  <p>Nor are the moſt Obvious <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alone explain'd by our <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> but thoſe Qualities eſteem'd Occult ones, ſince the Particles which are concern'd in ſuch Compoſitions, as abound with occult Qualities, are ſubject to the ſame Laws, and capable of the like manner of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; tho' their Parts are ſo Minute, as to make their <hi>Modus Operandi</hi> indiſcernible.</p>
                  <p>But what is ſtill more an Advantage in our <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis,</hi> is that it flies not to an unknown Power, as a <hi>Plaſtick</hi> one, or an <hi>Anima Mundi,</hi> whoſe Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is not known, but gives us a Mechanical Account of Things; for the former gives no more Satisfaction, than if one were told, that a Watch tells the Hours of the Day, becauſe made by ſuch a Man; whereas the true Reaſon is, becauſe the Parts ſo plac'd together are in Motion.</p>
                  <p>And the ſame Inſtances may ſerve to ſhew us the Deficiency of the <hi>Hypoſtatical</hi> Principles: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Ingredients by a bare mixture, being able to effect nothing, nor able to work upon each other, without Motion; thoſe Principles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, appear, to be only different Modes of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, vary'd by our <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude, There is not any one <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> which any <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> is able to explain; but a more Intelligible Account may be given by the following.</p>

                           <p>And theſe Conjectures may not be render'd a little probable, by obſerving, That tho' Spirit of Wine inwardly taken cauſes Heat; yet exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally it abates the Heat of inflamed Parts; but hath different Effects on a tender Eye: And though internally five Grains of Camphire may diffuſe Heat through the whole Body, yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally it is uſed in refrigerating Medicines.</p>
                           <p>How far theſe Obſervations may be of Service in determining whether Camphire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be hot or cold, I ſhall leave to Phyſicians to conſider, and ſhall here only offer in Proof, That Potential Coldneſs is only a relative Quality, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particulars, <hi>viz.</hi> That from the VI. and VII. Experiments it appears, that according to the Diſpoſitions of Bodies to be worked on, the Agent may have different Qualities: As Fumes of Lead may coagulate Mercury, tho' it hath not a like Effect on other Liquors: And further, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Sal-Armoniack</hi> and Nitre be, when ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, cool, and tho' the latter melted in a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible takes not Fire of it ſelf, yet upon an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Sal-Armoniack</hi> it flaſhes vehemently.

And this Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon was the more remarkable, becauſe the Oyl continued in that ſtate, when the Weather was too moderate to be the cauſe of ſuch an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; on the contrary I have obſerved, that Oyl of Anniſeeds, which uſually coagulates with a leſs degree of Cold than Water, continued undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd and tranſparent, without the leaſt Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation, in a very froſty Seaſon; and the like

                        <p>But to conclude this Section; If Heat depends on a brisk agitation of the Particles of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours about our Senſory, and if Cold be an Effect of a leſs degree of Motion than that about our Senſory; it appears that an Imminution of that Motion which is requiſite to produce Heat, is ſufficient to cauſe the contrary Quality, <hi>viz.</hi> Coldneſs. And tho' Cold ſeems in ſuch a Senſe a privitive Quality, yet in as much as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent which cauſes that Imminution acts poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Parts in motion; it may be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a poſitive Quality, tho' in reſpect of our Senſory it is but a relative one, as luke-warm Water will appear hot or cold, as the Hand im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſed in it hath either been expoſed to an intenſe degree of Cold or Heat. And indeed the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal miſtakes which ſometimes occur in Diſcourſes concerning Cold, happen upon the account of the ambiguity of that Expreſſion, which ſometimes is uſed to ſignifie the Idea imprinted on the Mind by the advention of an external Object; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for an Imminution of ſuch a Motion as cauſes Heat, and ſometimes for the Object upon a contact of which we perceive Cold.</p>

Nay ſometimes we judge amiſs of the degrees of Cold, when we think our Senſories unaltered; ſo Air blown out of a pair of Bellows upon the Senſory, by penetrating into the Pores and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tardating the Agitation of the Humors, ſeems Colder than before, yet when blown upon a common Weather-glaſs, that motion enables it not to depreſs the Mercury.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, ſometimes we may be more ſenſibly affected with Cold, when it depends not on the Qualities of the Air in general; but either on ſome Steams which are endowed with frigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifick Qualities, as <hi>Opium</hi> externally applied; or on ſome chilling diſtempered Humor in our Bodies.</p>
                     <p>But further, ſometimes Bodies appear colder to our Senſories than to a Weather-glaſs; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the former are more affected by the Denſity and Penetrancy of the Parts. So water hath appeared cold to our Bodies,<note place="margin">See Plate <hi>1.</hi> Fig. <hi>1.</hi>
                        </note> when by a nice Weather-glaſs I could not diſcover, that it was Colder than the Air.</p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:59609:604"/>
                     <p>Amongſt ſeveral Tryals made with theſe Weather-glaſſes, the following were remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                     <p>Having cauſed a Glaſs-Egg with a Stem, (ſuch as Fig. 1. Plate 1. Delineates,) to be blown at a Lamp, the Stem being dipped in Water, admitted into it a Cylinder of Water about half an Inch long, which, when the Pipe was erected, would ſubſide to the Bottom of the Cylinder, juſt where it riſes from the Egg, and there it would ſtand; but if the Glaſs-Egg was immerſed wholly in Water, or but half way in Quick-ſilver, the Water would aſcend up to the middle of the Cylinder, and ſubſide again when taken out.</p>
                     <p>In this Experiment ſeveral times repeated, I obſerved, That when the Glaſs-Egg was ſuddenly removed out of the Water, and immerſed in the Quick-ſilver, the Cylinder of Water would be raiſed higher; but if it was firſt immerſed in Quick-ſilver, and thence removed into Water, it would ſubſide, but not near ſo much as in the open Air. Theſe Tryals were made the 26th of <hi>June,</hi> the Weather being moderate. But being repeated another day when it was windy and rainy, the Aqueous Cylinder upon the immerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Thermometer ſubſided.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>June</hi> 27 in the morning, the Aqueous Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der would ſubſide when the Thermometer was immerſed in Water; but aſcend when it was depreſſed into Mercury; yet when the water had been kept in a warm Room ſome time, till it was as warm to the Touch, as the Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59609:605"/>they would both of them immediately raiſe the Mercury in the Pipe.</p>
                     <p>The like Experiment being tryed in <hi>January,</hi> in Froſty Weather, the Internal Air being of an equal temper with the External; when the Thermometer was immerſed in a ſhallow Veſſel of Water, the Aqueous Cylinder was raiſed half an Inch; and when it was immerſed in a deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Veſſel, it was raiſed as high again; but ſoon ſubſided when taken out into the free Air. From whence it appears, That we may be differently informed of the degrees of Heat and Cold, when we Employ our Organs of Touch, and when we make uſe of proper Inſtruments.</p>
                     <p>On this occaſion I ſhall ſubjoyn, that not only Water, but moiſt Vapours in the Air may cauſe it to ſeem Colder to our Senſories, than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Weather-glaſſes diſcover it to be. And tho' it be generally agreed, that a Themometer only more exactly meaſures the Effects which Cold hath upon it and our Senſories; yet I my ſelf have taken notice, that at the ſame time the Weather hath ſeemed cold to me, when the Weather-glaſs agreed not with the Information my Senſes gave me, which, that it did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from my <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <p>From what hath been ſaid, it appears, That it is requiſite to take notice when Birds and other Animals, whoſe Perception is more delicate than ours, ſeem to be affected with Cold, and likewiſe to examin the degrees of Coldneſs, as well by Experiments as by the Touch.</p>
                     <p>For a further Confirmation of what I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered on this occaſion, I ſhall add what <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinius</hi>

                     <p>But tho' I have urged the neceſſity and uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Weather-glaſſes, as preferable to the Informations we receive from our Senſes; yet, tho' they are not obnoxious to the ſame Cauſes of uncertainty, they are apt ſometimes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us; ſince in common Weather-glaſſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that the external or internal Air may be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified or condenſed by Heat and Cold, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent Atmoſphere being contiguous to the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59609:606"/>ſuſpended Liquor, it may be boyed up by an additional Gravity, as well as Heat, in the Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere and <hi>Vice verſâ</hi> as we have experienced by a ſtatical Baroſcope, whoſe Ballance would turn with the 500th part of a Grain. And likewiſe by conveying a common Weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs into the bottom of a deep Pit; and at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time by raiſing it up to the top of a Church or Steeple, and comparing it at the ſame time with a more exact Thermometer; for, by this Method, it appeared, that the riſing and falling of the Water in the common Weather-glaſs, depended not on the temperature of the Air as to Heat or Cold, but on the different altitude of the Atmoſpherical Pillar of Air incumbent on the Water.</p>
                     <p>But beſides the Gravity of the Atmoſphere, there may be other Cauſes of the aſcent and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of the Liquor in common Weather-glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as well as Heat and Cold. For not to urge, that tho' the height of the ſame Atmoſpherical Pillar of Air ſhould ſeem unaltered, the Weather-glaſs remaining in the ſame place; yet the weight of the Air may be increaſed by the copious diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Vapours and heavy Steams through the Air, and alſo may be diminiſhed upon a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation of thoſe by Dew or Rain; which Effects may perhaps be falſly attributed to different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Heat or Cold. To be ſatisfy'd of the truth of what I have here hinted, I tryed the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Experiments.</p>
                     <p>I took two Weather-glaſſes of a more than ordinary length,<note place="margin">See Plate <hi>1.</hi> Fig. <hi>2d.</hi> and <hi>3d.</hi>
                        </note> the diviſions of one of which were half Inches, and thoſe of the other not much leſs. The one, which was furniſhed with
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59609:606"/>good Spirit of Wine (ſee Plate 1. Fig. 3.) was ſealed. The other (ſee Plate 1. Fig. 2.) was not ſealed; but was ſo contrived, that the Air being ſhut up in the lower part of the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, might riſe with Heat and fall with Cold. In theſe Thermoſcopes I obſerved, That in that which was ſealed, the Liquor regularly aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in warm Weather and ſubſided in cold: But in the other, there being a little hole left open at the top, it was remarkable, That tho' when the Atmoſphere continu'd to be of the ſame weight, it would regularly riſe and fall; yet when the Gravity of the Atmoſphere was alter'd, it would not exaltly correſpond with the other; for as when the incumbent Pillar of Air was hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier than ordinary, the Liquor would not be raiſed high enough by Heat, the preſſure of that Air reſiſting it: So, on the other hand, when the Atmoſphere was lighter than ordinary; the Liquor in the unſealed Glaſs would riſe too high. So that by comparing the two Thermometers together,<note place="margin">See Plate <hi>1.</hi> Fig. <hi>4.</hi>
                        </note> I could tell, whether the Mercury in the <hi>Torrecellian Tube</hi> (ſee Plate 1. Fig. 4) was riſen or fallen, and <hi>Vice verſa;</hi> the riſing and falling of the Mercurial Cylinder one quarter of an Inch; uſually ſignifies a great diſparity betwixt the aſcent or deſcent of the Liquors in the two Inſtruments.</p>
                     <p>The difference betwixt the height of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors in the two Thermometers laſt Night, was but 1 or 2 Diviſions: To day, the Barometer making it evident, that the Air was much lighter; the Liquor in the unſealed Thermoſcope was at 58. Tho' in the other, the number of the Diviſions it ſtood at was but 41; yet a Week ago, when the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59609:607"/>Mercury in the Barometer was much higher, and the Liquor in the ſealed Weather-glaſs ſtood at 46, that in the other was no higher than 27. So that in a Week's time the Liquor in the ſealed Thermoſcope deſcended 5 Degrees, and that in the unſealed one aſcended 31.</p>
                     <p>At another time I obſerv'd, that when the Mercury in the Barometer was higher than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, the Liquor in the ſealed Glaſs ſtood at the 50th Diviſion, but in the other it was fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len to 32 in warm Sun-ſhiny weather; ſo that an unheeded change in the weight of the Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere, may have a greater power to compreſs the included Air in an unſealed Weather-glaſs, than a conſiderable degree of warmth may have to dilate it; and conſequently it may happen in an ordinary Weather-glaſs, where the Air is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded at the top, that the pendulous Water may riſe in warm weather and fall in cold weather.</p>
                     <p>For a further Confirmation of what I have been ſaying, I ſhall add, That even Yeſter-night I obſerv'd, that the Mercury in the Barometer being at 39 Inches, the Liquor in the ſealed Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rometer was at the 40th Diviſion, and in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at 39 ½ but this Night the Mercury being raiſed ¼ of an Inch, the Liquor in the ſealed Glaſs roſe to 45, the other being depreſſed to 34 ½. The Night following, the Mercury being raiſed ¾ of an Inch, the Liquor in the ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Glaſs continu'd at the 40th Diviſion; the Liquor in the other in two Days time having been depreſs'd to the 17th, that is 23 Diviſions. Two or three Days after, the Mercury being riſen to 30 Inches, the Liquor in the ſealed Glaſs
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59609:607"/>was at 41; the other was depreſs'd below the 9th Diviſion, being 33 Diviſions lower than the other.</p>
                     <p>The Day after, the Mercury continuing at the ſame height, and the weather growing much colder, it ſubſided uniformly enough; that in the ſealed Glaſs ſubſiding to the 33 and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther below the loweſt Mark of all: Which diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ſtill continu'd ſo great betwixt the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors of the two Thermometers, becauſe the Air to Day was very heavy; whereas at another time when the Atmoſphere was not ſo heavy, and the Mercury was ſuſpended at 29 Inches and leſs than a half; the Liquor in the Herme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Glaſs ſtood at 34 when the Liquor in the other was not below 41.</p>
                     <p>But once I obſerv'd the difference betwixt the two Weather-glaſſes to be greater than any I have recorded yet; it being near 45 Diviſions. And a few Hours ago I obſerv'd, when the Mercury in a Baroſcope had riſen above ¼ of an Inch higher than it was the Night before, the Liquor in the ſhank of the Weather-glaſs was depreſſed above an Inch below the ſurface of the ambient Liquor in the Viol, and in the Night was ſo far depreſſed, that a Bubble of the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Air made its way out at the bottom of the Tube, and joyn'd with the common Air in the Cavity of the Viol; an Effect which the coldneſs of the Seaſon could not give one hopes to expect; the Pipe in which the Liquor was contained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 20 Inches long.</p>

Beſides it is a Quality, for whoſe differences there are very few diſtinct Names there being a great many Intermediate degree of Cold, betwixt Luke-warm and Freezing; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

And further, tho' it be not difficult to include in the Cavity of a Weather-glaſs, another Body inſtead of Air; yet it cannot be done, without being liable to receive Impreſſions from the Atmoſphere, when firſt put up.</p>
                     <p>But tho' it be difficult to get a Standard of Cold for to judge of it's degrees by, yet I have ſometines thought, That Oyl of Aniſeeds, which is coagulated in Cold and thawed again in warm Weather;<note place="margin">An Ingenious Gentleman propos'd to ſettle a Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard for Weather-glaſſes, by obſerving the Effects of ſuch a degree of Cold as is requiſite to freeze Diſtilled Water, and it may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageouſly made uſe of when ſtrong enough to freeze Water.</note> might enable us to make two Thermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters exactly correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: If the ball of the Thermoſcope being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſed in Oyl of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeds melted, we obſerve what ſtation the Spirit of Wine ſtands at, when it juſt begins to coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late: But in doing of it we are to obſerve, That the Cavities of the Glaſſes and the Quantity of the Spirit of Wine ought to be as equal as can be; otherwiſe the ſucceſs will be much more uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Which way of Eſtimating Weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſes, tho' it be not ſo certain as unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to anſwer expectation, yet it may be of advantage to come as near as we can to certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59609:609"/>that there be a certain Proportion betwixt the Diameter of the Cylinder, and that of the Pipe. Beſides, open Weather-glaſſes may be more Commodiouſly contrived for Thermometrical Experiments than thoſe that are commonly made uſe of;<note place="margin">See Plate <hi>1.</hi> Fig. <hi>2.</hi>
                        </note> (See Plate 1. Fig. 2.) In which, the mouth of the Vial being ſo cloſed with ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or wax, that the External Air hath no communication with it but through the Pipe; upon an Expanſion or Condenſation of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Air, the Liquor hath much more Room to riſe and fall in, than the Pendulous Liquor in ordinary Glaſſes, where the Quantity of Air is much too ſmall in reſpect of the Proportion of the Cavity into which it muſt expand it ſelf, when rarified; to make the riſing or falling of the Liquor in that, to be ſo ſenſible enough. But beſides, that this of ours hath this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that the Quantity of Air is greater in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Proportion of the Cylinder, and conſequently the Water hath much more Room to play up and down in; it hath this advantage further, that it is much more convenient for our purpoſe: Since the Ball of it may be immerſed in Bodies, whoſe Coldneſs we have a mind to meaſure; and conſiſtent Bodies, as Snow or Ice may be more conveniently heaped about it, than common Weather-glaſſes.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Men too Confidently conclude, that if the Liquor in a Thermoſcope riſe an Inch higher to day,<note place="margin">A third Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> than it was the day before, and an Inch higher the next, that the Air muſt be as Cold again the laſt day as it was the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſince it appears not, tho' we ſhould allow that Cold of it ſelf contracts the Air, That a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59609:609"/>double degree of Cold muſt produce a double degree of Condenſation exactly; for beſides that the different Quantities of Air contained in theſe Inſtruments, and the Proportions of Pipes, as well as the degrees of the Expanſions conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered together are ſufficient to render the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis ſuſpicious: I am inclined to believe, That the Condenſation of the Air and the aſcent of the Water depend on the Preſſure of the ambient Air, as we ſhall in a little time make appear, and then this Computation will be found to be very fallacious: For we have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſhewn, that the forces required to compreſs Air, is in Reciprocal Proportions or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, to the ſpaces comprehending the ſame proportion of Air; ſo that if a Cylinder of four Inches be able to reſiſt a Preſſure equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to ten Pounds weight, when it comes to be compreſſed into two Inches; an equal force ſuper-added to the former, will drive up that already compreſſed Air into half the ſpace, which is about an Inch: Whence it follows, that in eſtimating the Condenſation of the Air in a Weather-glaſs, we muſt not only Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how much Space it is made to deſert; but alſo what Proportion that deſerted Space bears to the whole Space it poſſeſs'd before, and to what degree of Denſity it was brought before the Application of that force: And we muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that the reſiſtance of the Included Air is not to be looked upon as that of a weight, which may remain always the ſame; but that of a Spring forcibly bent, whoſe reſiſtance is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt as it is crouded into leſs Room.</p>

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The fourth Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>Fourthly, we ought to have a regard to the particular Nature of the Liquors employed in Weather-glaſſes, till we have a more determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Theory of the cauſe of Cold: For amongſt Liquors, it does not follow, That becauſe the one is moſt ſubject to be affected with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degrees of Cold, and to freeze; that the other is leſs ſuſceptible of the lower degrees of it: Since it is obſerved, That Spirit of Wine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives notable Impreſſions from fainter degrees of Cold, than Water does, when made uſe of in Weather-glaſſes; tho' in our Climate the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is much more readily turned into Ice. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we are not to conclude, That all Subtil and moſt Spirituous Liquors muſt be leaſt capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being congealed; ſince Oyl of Aniſeeds Diſtilled by a Limbeck, is extremely hot; yet will it be congealed by a much gentler degree of Cold than Water, and will be longer undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon a Thaw.

                     <p>And indeed, if we allow, that Cold depends on a Diminution of the uſual motion of the Parts of a Body; I ſee not, beſides thoſe more Catholick Agents which produce Cold in moſt Bodies they invade; why one Body may not be ſaid to be more or leſs frigorifick in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of this or that Body, and not of a third?

And tho' <hi>Opium</hi> refrigerates not Water, as I have experienced by the help of a good Weather-glaſs; yet a few Grains of it preſently refrigerate the Maſs of Blood; which is not only an argument, That moſt Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors have peculiar Textures; but that the Parts of one Body may be ſo conveniently ſhaped as to be able, by inſinuating into the Pores of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, to ſtop the Agitation of their Parts. And in favour of what we have laid down, I ſhall further add, That I know more Liquors than one, which, mingled with Spirit of Wine well dephelgmed, will preſently deprive it of it's Fluidity; and the like change I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times obſerved in other Liquors: And I can make a Liquor much of the ſame temper of Water, that receives a degree of Coldneſs by the Addition of a certain ſubſtance which ſtops the Agitation of it's Parts; that would ſcarce have any ſenſible effect on Water.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed to what we have further to offer in favour of our new Thermometers,<note place="margin">Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the new Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mometers.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that the Water and Air may be both al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately condenſed, without the influence of the Atmoſphere's gravity; they have another advantage, That they may be uſed in ſeveral Places, and removed without ſpilling the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor contained in them, or without danger of it being evaporated. Beſides they may be ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let down into any Liquor, even the moſt Corroſive; it we have a mind to examine their
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59609:611"/>In doing of which, inſtead of Liquors made uſe of in common Glaſſes, we employ Spirit of Wine tinged with Cochineele, opened by the moſt Volatile Spirit of Urine, which is not only in leſs danger of being froze, but ſuſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the ſlighteſt degrees of Cold impreſſed upon it by external Bodies. But tho' we think theſe Weather-glaſſes ſubject to fewer Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons than common ones; yet in eſtimating, the ſeveral degrees of Cold, we look upon them as Inſtruments to be employed by our Reaſon, and not quite exempt from thoſe Imperfections, we have imputed to Weather-glaſſes; ſince I ſuſpect, that ſome ſort of Steams, penetrateing the Pores of the Glaſſes, may have other effects upon the Spirit of Wine, than what they have in reference to Heat and Cold: For I once ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, that having immerſed the Ball of a Weather-glaſs in a ſtrange kind of a Luke-warm mixture, the Spirit roſe up ſlowly 8 or 9 In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in a Tube not above a foot long; and ſubſided not again much above half an Inch when expoſed to the Air a good while after it had been immerſed in Water 5 hours. The Chymiſt <hi>Orthelius</hi> in his <hi>Theatrum Chymicum</hi> Vol. 6. tells us, That the Liquor Diſtilled from the Oar of <hi>Magneſia</hi> or <hi>Biſmute,</hi> will ſwell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably in the Glaſs it is kept in at the full Moon, and ſubſide at the New; which obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Jeſuit <hi>Caſatus</hi> makes uſe of as an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And I have obſerved my ſelf a Tincture of Amber made with rectified Spirit of Wine, undergoe ſeveral changes, when ſtopped up in a Bottle, which other Liquors abounding with Spirit of Wine did not; ſo that not unlikely,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59609:611"/>if Weather-glaſſes furniſhed with different Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors were kept together in the ſame Place, there would be ſome diſparity, which could be aſcribed to nothing but the peculiar Natures of the reſpective Liquors, which, tho' of different kinds, may receive the ſame Colour from the ſame Metals: So Copper gives the known Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and affords a fair Solution in <hi>Aqua Regis,</hi> as well as gives a lovely Blew to Spirit of Urine, or <hi>Sal Armoniac;</hi> and I have found, that it would give a good Tincture to Chymical Oyl of Turpentine.</p>
                     <p>And to ſhew, that even Spirit of Wine in Weather-glaſſes may be worked upon and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by external Bodies, I ſhall add, That I have obſerved in one that lay by me ſome time, emergent Bubbles: Which whether they were only made up of united Bubbles lodged in the Pores of the Liquor, or ſome Parts of the Wine diſpoſed to Elaſticity by frequent alterations; I examin not: But ſometimes they have been ſo great as to poſſeſs many Inches of ſpace in the ſhank of the Weather-glaſs; which Bubbles, if they be ſmall and lurk about the juncture of the Ball and of the Cylinder; may, by dividing the Spirit in the Stem from that in the Ball, hinder it from riſing according to the Changes of the Weather; a Bubble of Air being more dicffiultly removed up and down in the Stem of the Glaſs, than the Spirit it ſelf; in favour of which, we have elſe-where ſhewn, That Water will paſs through a narrower ſpace than Air, except the latter be forced.</p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:59609:612"/>
                     <p>But to draw near to a concluſion, tho' I have mentioned all theſe difficulties about ſealed Glaſſes; I would not be thought to do it with a deſign to ſet Men upon greater Nicities than are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but rather to excite us to take into our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration as many collateral Experiments and Obſervations; beſides thoſe made by our Senſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, on Natural as well as Factitious Bodies, in judging of the degrees of Cold as we can: For tho' Water be thought to be moſt ſuſceptible of ſuch an intenſe degree of Cold as deſtroys Fluidity, yet beſides Oyl of Aniſeeds, I have diſtill'd a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from <hi>Benzoin,</hi> which becomes fluid and conſiſtent upon much ſlighter alterations as to Heat and Cold, than would freeze Water or thaw it: And I have obſerved likewiſe, That Amber-greaſe diſſolv'd in highly rectified Spirit of Wine, or in other Sulphereous or Reſinous Concretions diſſolved in the ſame Liquor; will ſhoot into fine figured Maſſes in cold Weather, and re-diſſolve in warm; others being more rudely congealed. And even in Chymical Preparations of Harts-horn and Urine, I have obſerved, That ſometimes the Spirits would be clear, and at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times would ſuffer a greater or leſs quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Salt to Chryſtallize at the bottom; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the various alterations of the Weather, in point of Heat or Cold.</p>
                     <p>But to bring Inſtances from more obvious Liquors, it is obſerved in ſome Parts of <hi>France</hi> by the Water-men, That their Boats will carry greater Loads in Winter than Summer; and on frozen Coaſts in ſeveral Countries it is obſerved, That Ships draw leſs Water than on our Britiſh Coaſts; which is an Argument, that the Water
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59609:612"/>is heavier and thicker in Winter than in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. And I my ſelf have poiſed a Bubble ſo exactly, with Water in it; that tho' it would ſwim upon the top of the Water at Night; yet in the Day, when the Sun had rarified the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it ſwam in, it would ſubſide to the bottom: And ſometimes was ſo exactly of a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent weight with, and ſo equally poiſed in the Water, that it would neither ſubſide nor ſwim upon the top, but move up and down till the Water was either more rarified or further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Concerning the cauſe of the Condenſation of the Air, and aſcent of Water by Cold in common Weather-glaſſes.</head>
                     <p>COncerning the Reaſon, why Water in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Weather-glaſſes deſcends upon Heat, and is raiſed by Cold? there are three Opinions which may deſerve our Conſideration.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Schools con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the aſcent of Water in Weather-glaſſes exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</note>The firſt is, that of the Schools and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Peripateticks, which teaches, That the external Air condenſing that included in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Weather-glaſſes; it riſes to fill up that ſpace deſerted by the Air to prevent a <hi>Vacuum.</hi> But not to urge, That they have not yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that Nature will not admit of a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> or that it is contrary to the Notion a Naturaliſt ought to have of Matter; to ſuppoſe it to act any thing contrary to its own natural tendency for a publick Good: I ſay not to urge theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which we have elſewhere made uſe of; I ſhall alledge the following Experiment. <hi>viz.</hi> That,</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Doctrine.</note>If a Bolt-head with a long Stem be made uſe of to try the <hi>Torrecellian</hi> Experiment with, the ſpace deſerted by the Mercury in the Cavity of the Bolt-head, and from whence the Mercury drove the Air, continues void; the Pendulous Cylinder remaining at 30 Inches, without offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to aſcend to prevent a <hi>Vacuum.</hi> Nor will the Quick-ſilver riſe ¼ of an Inch higher upon the application of cold Bodies outwardly; tho' in a common Thermometer, the ſame degree of Cold would make Water aſcend ſeveral Inches.</p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:59609:613"/>
                     <p>To this I ſhall add another Argument taken from the conſideration of ſealed Weather-glaſſes (ſee Plate 1. Fig. 3.) in which it is obſerved,<note place="margin">See Plate <hi>1.</hi> Fig. <hi>3.</hi>
                        </note> That the Air, inſtead of contracting upon an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Cold, expands it ſelf. If it be ſaid, That the Water contracting the Air follows it to prevent a <hi>Vacuum;</hi> it may be demanded, Why, ſince Nature cauſes the one to contract in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Glaſſes, and the other in ſealed ones, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void a <hi>Vacuum;</hi> ſhe does not rather make the Air retain its natural extenſion than ſuffer it to be condenſed, and then put her ſelf to double trouble, in compelling the Water to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend contrary to its nature?</p>
                     <p>But not to inſiſt on theſe Arguments, I ſhall rather urge, that what is offered by them will not ſolve the Difficulty; for whether the Water or Air be expanded into a large ſpace, ſince Glaſs is impervious to Air and Water; I ſee not how a <hi>Vacuum interſperſum</hi> and <hi>coacervatum</hi> can be avoided: For if upon the expanſion, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Body is added and penetrates the Glaſs to fill the ſpace deſerted by ſome Parts of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded Body, there muſt remain Vacuities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them: Becauſe it is impoſſible, the ſame quantity of Matter ſhould compleatly and ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quately fill a greater ſpace by being expanded; the Parts of the Body being only able inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quately to fill it by receding from each other: But were it allowed, that upon the expanſion of one of theſe Bodies, and the condenſation of the other, a third Subſtance harboured in the ſpace deſerted by the one; it may be queſtioned, how ſuch Matter ſhould make its way out again?</p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:59609:614"/>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> his Doctrine examined.</note>The ſecond Opinion I ſhall take notice of, is that of Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> which is to me partly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious, partly inſufficient, and ſcarce intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for tho' when he aſſerts, That the coldneſs of Liquors depends on their being preſſed with a conſtant Wind, beſides that he aſſerts it without Proof; it will appear from an Experiment ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be alledged, That Liquors ſealed up in Glaſſes, and ſuſpended in Liquors not ſubject to freeze, may be refrigerated; tho' it appears not how they can be raked on by the Wind as his Hypotheſis requires.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſee no neceſſity, that the Cold ſhould preſs upon the ſuperficies of the Water in the Shank; ſince by Cold it will be raiſed in a Weather-glaſſeſs, kept in a ſtill Place and void of any ſenſible Wind. Beſides, he ought to ſhew, Why Air inſenſibly moved deſerves to be ſtyled Wind, and how it is poſſible ſuch a Wind ſhould raiſe Water ſo many Inches by preſſing upon it? Nay further, Water poured into a Bolt-head till it reaches into the Stem, will ſubſide when refrigerated, and not riſe. And if the Ball of a Weather-glaſs be encompaſſed with a mixture of Ice, or Snow and Salt; the Water will readily aſcend; which how it will be explained by Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s Hypotheſis, I do not ſee.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> allowing not of a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> I wonder he ſhould tell us, That by a bare Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the Water finding no other Place to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede into, is forced to riſe into the ſhank of the Weather-glaſs: For ſince, according to him, the ſhank of the Weather-glaſs muſt be full be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; I ſee not how it ſhould be able to receive the aſcending Water, except to uſe Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59609:614"/>own words, <hi>it can be fuller than full.</hi> Beſides, it may be further alledged againſt Mr <hi>Hobbes</hi> his Doctrine, that it gives us no account of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſation of the Air by Cold, in Weather-glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in which the Water deſcends with Cold and riſes with Heat.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, whereas Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> in explaining the depreſſion of Water in Weather-glaſſes, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes it ſolely to it's own Gravity; it will eaſily appear, that we muſt likewiſe have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the ſpring of the included Air: For if a Thermometer be placed in the Sun, when the Water in the ſhank is but a little above the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Water without the Tube; the rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Air will depreſs the Surface of the Water in the Pipe below the other, and ſometimes ſo far, that ſome of the rarified Air making it's way out of the Pipe, as ſoon as the remaining Air is refrigerated again, the Water will be able to riſe up higher into the Tube than it did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">A Modern Opinion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined.</note>The third and laſt Opinion I ſhall conſider is one held by ſome modern Naturaliſts, which aſcribes the Aſcent of the Water to the Preſſure of the Air gravitating upon the Surface of that Water without the Pipe; but ſuppoſes that the Air contained in it, is contracted by Cold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: As for the firſt Part of this Hypotheſis, I readily Aſſent to it;<note place="margin">and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</note> but am apt to believe that the contraction of the included Air depends on the ſame Cauſe, and that the ſpring of it being weakened by Cold, it is condenſed by the ſame Preſſure of the Atmoſphere; the weight of the External Air over-powering the weakened Spring of the Internal.</p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:59609:615"/>
                     <p>In favour of this Opinion I ſhall add the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Experiments,<note place="margin">See Plate <hi>1.</hi> Fig. 5.</note> and Firſt, having filled a Vial capable of holding five or ſix Ounces, half full (See Plate 1. Fig. <hi>5.</hi>) and having inverted a Glaſs Tube into it, about 10 Inches long, much bigger than a Swan's Quill, it being firſt ſealed at one end and filled with Water; the Orifice of the Vial was cloſed with Cement, ſo that the External and Internal Air, had no communication with each other: It was placed in a Mixture of Snow and Salt, till the Water in the Bottom of the Vial began to freeze; yet notwithſtanding ſo great a degree of refrigera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Water in the Tube did not at all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend; ſo that either the Air was not conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Cold, or the Water deſcended not to prevent a <hi>Vacuum.</hi> The Glaſs being left in this Poſture, in our abſence, the ſealed end of the Pipe flew off; being beaten out by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumeſcence of the freezing Water.</p>
                     <p>Having fixed another Pipe as the former, which was ſome Inches longer, and drawn ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſlender at the ſealed end, that it might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be broken; this was ſet to freeze as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet the Water deſcended not, but as ſoon as the top of the Glaſs-Tube was broke off, the external Air preſſing upon the Water, and by the intercourſe of that upon the Air; the Water in the Tube ſubſided 8 or 10 Inches, but roſe again when the internal Air was rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, within half an Inch of the top; and then the Apex being ſealed up it was placed in Snow and Salt, yet the Air in the top, had it's Spring ſo weakened by refrigeration, that it was not able to depreſs the Water; tho' as ſoon as the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59609:615"/>Apex was broke off, it ſubſided ſeveral Inches, the external Air preſſing upon it.</p>
                     <p>The Experiment being a third time reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with 3 ½ of Air in the Pipe, when the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Vial was in ſome meaſure froze, it was able to expand it ſelf a little: But when the Apex was broke off, the External Air de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the Surface of the Water two Inches, but being removed into a warm Room it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended above an Inch higher than the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Level.</p>
                     <p>Having put ſo much Water into a Veſſel,<note place="margin">See Plate <hi>1.</hi> Fig. <hi>6.</hi>
                        </note> (Such as Plate 1. Fig. 6. Delineates) as was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to fill almoſt the whole Tube, we cauſed a Mixture of Snow and Salt to be placed about the Ball of it, yet we perceived not the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the leaſt to riſe; but if at all, it might well be aſcribed to the the Intumeſcence of ſome airy Parts lodged in the Pores of the Water. But the Apex of the Tube being broke off under Water, the External Air forced the Water ſeveral Inches up into the Cavity of the Pipe.</p>
                     <p>Another Experiment we made with the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Veſſel (See Plate 1. Fig. 7) the Stem of this being no thicker than a Raven's Quill tho' ſeveral Inches long,<note place="margin">See Plate <hi>1.</hi> Fig. <hi>7.</hi>
                        </note> and the Ball being about as big as a Nutmeg; we dropped a few drops of Water into the Stem which being ſuſpended there, betrayed very ſlight changes in the Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction or Condenſation of the internal Air. Watching therefore when the Air within had raiſed the Bubble up to the top of the Stem; we immediately ſealed it up, and obſerved, That tho' the ſealed Glaſs was placed in a Mixture of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59609:616"/>Snow and Salt, the Bubble did not in the leaſt ſubſide: But if the Apex of the Stem was broke off, the Bubble of Water would be ſometimes depreſſed ſo low, as to fall into the Ball of the Weather-glaſs. And what was further remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, was, That when the Liquor was deſcending, if the end of the Tube was ſealed up; the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would immediately ſtop at the place it reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, when the Preſſure of the Atmoſphere was taken off: Where it would continue till the Stem was broke open again, and then the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would be further depreſſed; as the weight of the Atmoſphere was able to over-power the Reſiſtance made by the internal Air.</p>
                     <p>Having made uſe of ſuch a Veſſel (as Fig. 7. Plate 1.) repreſents and conveyed a pretty Quantity of Water into both the Legs,<note place="margin">See Plate <hi>1.</hi> Fig. <hi>7.</hi>
                        </note> we ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the end of the bent Stem; leaving ſo much Air above it, as we thought convenient: Which being done, we placed the Ball of it in a frame, in which, the Tube hanging down, we could cover the round Ball with Snow and Salt: Upon which the Air in the Stem was able to expand it ſelf ſo far, that the Water in the longer Leg was raiſed the length of a Barly-corn higher than before, and depreſſed as much in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: But when the end of the Stem was broke open, the Water was raiſed 2 ¼ Inches in the longer Leg, and depreſſed ſo low in the ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that ſeveral Bubbles roſe into the Cavity of the Ball.</p>
                     <p>In which Experiment it cannot be ſuppoſed, That the weight of the Water in the ſhorter Leg could be able, to raiſe the Water in the other, except by Virtue of it's Spring, which being
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59609:616"/>but ſmall, anſwerable to the Quantity of of it; it cannot be expected that it ſhould have any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Effect upon the Air in the other Leg; tho' it's Spring were in ſome meaſure weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Cold.</p>

                        <p>BEfore we proceed to the natural Hiſtory of Cold, it perhaps may be neceſſary to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what Bodies are capable of retaining ſuch Qualities, and what are not; but that being a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration not ſo neceſſary to our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which is only to ſet down what Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations we have made in Bodies ſubject to be froze; I ſhall only in ſhort take notice, That moſt Bodies, except fire, are ſuſceptible of actual Cold, and it is a Queſtion whether even that be not rather a ſtate of Matter in ſuch a peculiar motion, than a diſtinct and particular ſpecies of Natural Bodies; ſince even Gun-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and Spirit of Wine before they are ſet on fire by ſome other Body are actually Cold. But to proceed to what Obſervations relate to our Title.</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <note place="margin">Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Bodies ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of freezing others.</note>1. Bodies cold enough to freeze others are very few here in <hi>England;</hi> Snow and Salt mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed being moſt remarkable; which cool the Liquor contained in thoſe Veſſels, which are cloſed up in ſuch mixtures.</p>
                        <pb n="39" facs="tcp:59609:617"/>
                        <p n="2">2. Snow alone would not freeze Water, as a Mixture of it and Salt does; and tho' Water poured betwixt the Interſtices of Snow or Ice freezes; yet there is a great diſparity, betwixt expoſing it to the Air, and keeping it up in Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; and tho' it is froze, when covered with Snow in a Bottle all night, yet that may proceed from the Coldneſs of the Air, as well as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the Snow.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If Nitre, Allum, Vitriol, <hi>Sal-Armoniack,</hi> or Sugar be mixed in due Proportion with Snow; they will enable it to freeze, tho' not ſo intenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as common Salt.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Spirit of Salt being ſhaken together with Snow in the Vials, they cauſed a Dew which was gathered on the outſide the Glaſs to be froze; tho' the Mixture within was not, and Oyl of Vitriol mixed with Snow in a thin Vial, had the ſame Effect only more intenſely.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. But not only theſe Acid Spirits had theſe Effects on the moiſture of the Air condenſed on the outſide the Glaſſes; but likewiſe Spirit of Nitre, Spirit of Vinegar, and Spirit of Sugar, the former of theſe three being very powerfull, tho' the latter were not ſo ſtrongly frigorifick.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Spirit of Urine mixed with Snow in a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al froze the External moiſture weakly; but Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniack</hi> drawn from Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime did it powerfully.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Spirit of Urine and Oyl of Vitriol poured upon Snow, froze moderately.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. <hi>Sal Gem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> with a ſublimate made with common ſublimate and <hi>Sal-Armoniack;</hi> nay, and with both loaf and Kitchin-Sugar; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a ſtrong ſolution of Pot-aſhes mixed with
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59609:618"/>Snow did freeze, tho' very faintly. And both a Solution of Salt of Tartar and Pot-aſhes Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated with Snow in a ſmall Vial, produced Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of Ice on the outſide the Glaſs, tho' very thin ones.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. A ſweet Solution of <hi>Minium</hi> in Spirit of Vinegar mixed with Snow, excited the frigori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Quality of it; yet ſome of that Solution being encloſed in Snow and Salt, would not be froze by them. Snow ſhut up alone, thawed much more ſlowly, than that which was mixed with Salts or Spirits. No Salts will promote the frigorifick Quality of Snow, ſo far as to enable it to freeze, which quicken not it's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. Neither Chryſtals of Tartar, nor Borax, both beaten to powder, nor Sublimate would enable Snow to freeze, as well as the Powder of each lying undiſſolved in it.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. Water of Quick-lime being twice tryed would not freeze, but only gather a dew on the outſide; yet the Liquor being kept up 12 Months the Spirits with which thoſe Waters abound flew away.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. Oyl of Turpentine in which Ice diſſolves ſlower than in ſeveral other Liquors enables not Snow to freeze. Tho' Spirit of Wine ſhut up with Snow in a Bottle, enabled it to freeze powerfully, and to Chryſtalize even Urine it ſelf, which might be taken off in Scales.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. Spirit of Nitre and Snow being mixed together in a juſt Proportion froze very pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully and ſpeedily, not only Water but Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Vinegar, and weak Spirit of Salt; the firſt of which retained it's taſte, when froze, and the latter ſhot into Chryſtals which lay acroſs
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59609:618"/>each other. A Solution of <hi>Sal-Armoniack</hi> part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evaporated would ſhoot into Chryſtals like combs and feathers, and <hi>Sal-Armoniack</hi> diſtill'd from Quick-lime would ſhoot into Branches al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt like thoſe, ſo nimbly, that one's Eye might diſcern them to ſpread and increaſe. The like Experiments being tryed with Wine and ſtrong Ale ſucceeded, but very faintly.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. Since Bodies generally help Snow to freeze, which haſten it's diſſolution; we threw into a Vial, which contained Snow, heated Sand, which enabled it to cauſe a Dew, but not to freeze. And warm Water poured into another, when it had been ſhaken, produced a conſiderable degree of Cold, and gathered Dew, but froze it not.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. Tho' it is generally believed, That the Hoar-froaſt on Glaſs-windows, is only exſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations through the Pores of the Glaſs, and froze by the External Cold; yet it will eaſily appear, That it is rather on the inſide the Glaſs; the Steams which rove up and down the Room being condenſed by the External Cold, and froze.</p>
                        <p n="15">15. To ſhew, That the Ice which appears on the outſide of the Vial in the fore-going Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, proceeds not from any ſubtil Parts of the Mixture penetrating the Pores of the Glaſs and ſettling on the outſide; we found that four Ounces and ¼ of the Mixture of Ice and Salt, being ſhut up in a Vial, by the acceſs of Dew on the outſide, the weight of it was increaſed 12 Grains. Another Vial which contained two Ounces ſix Drams and a half increaſed in weight 4 Grains; the Vial being unſealed under Water,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59609:619"/>it ſucked in a good quantity of it. Six ounces Snow and Salt being ſealed up in a Glaſs, the Hoar-Froſt was wiped off but returned again; and the Vial being counterpoiſed in a pair of Scales, the Vapours condenſed by the coldneſs of it, in the time that the Snow was melting, weighed 10 Grains. A like quantity of Snow and Spirit of Wine being ſhut up in a ſingle Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, the outſide was preſently cover'd with Ice, and in all it became 7 Grains heavier than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Another time a mixture of Snow and Salt, which weighed 3 ¾ ounces, afforded 18 grains of condenſed Vapours. And a mixture of Snow and <hi>Sal-Gem.</hi> which counterpoiſed 3 ounces and 70 grains, upon an additional weight of condenſed Vapours, weighed 20 grains more than before.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. Freezing hath been ſo generally eſteemed, the utmoſt Effect of Cold, That moſt have been content, without examining ſtrictly the ſeveral degrees of it. Nor indeed is it very eaſily done, ſince if we do it with common Weather-glaſſes it will be a hard thing to diſtinguiſh whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Cold of one Day, exceeds that of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; ſince there intervening ſo much time betwixt the Obſervations, the Alterations may be cauſed by an increaſe in the weight of the Atmoſphere. And ſhould we make an eſtimate by the Teſtimony of our Senſes, we ſhould eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be miſtaken; ſince it is believed, That the different ſenſations of Cold which we perceive, depend on the various Diſpoſitions of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:59609:622"/>
                        <p>But allowing, that vulgar Thermometers might give us a true Information of the degrees of Cold, which Nature affords, yet they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint us not whether Art may not produce greater; much leſs will they help us to make an eſtimate of this Diſparity. And though we may make ſome gueſs by the Operation of Cold on Liquors expoſed to it, yet ſome as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queous Liquors freeze too ſoon, and vinous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors here in <hi>England</hi> will not freeze at all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>French</hi> Wine; which happens ſeldom and leaves too great an Interval betwixt the degrees neceſſary to congeal Wine, and ſufficient to freeze Water, beſides the uncertainty proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the ſeveral ſtrengths of Wines.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore to diſcover the Intenſity of Cold, produced by Art above the higheſt degree that Nature affords,<note place="margin">See Plate. <hi>1.</hi> Fig. <hi>1.</hi>
                           </note> we furniſhed a ſealed Weather-glaſs (Such as Plate 1. Fig. 1. Delineates) with Spirit of Wine, and immerſed the Ball and part of the Stem in a Veſſel of Water, which was half buried in Snow and Salt, and when the Water began to freeze at the bottom and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſides, the Liquor was Subſided to 5 2/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, each Diviſion being half an Inch; and then the Weather-glaſs being taken out of the Water and applied to the Snow and Salt, it Subſided to 1 ½ Diviſion.</p>
                        <p>To this we ſhall add another which ſhews, That the Water tho' froze was warmer than the Spirit of Wine, when the Mixture of Snow and Salt was applied to it. <hi>Jan.</hi> 15 the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-glaſs being kept in the Water till it began to freeze deſcended to 5 ½ but being removed into the Snow and Salt it Subſided firſt briskly
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59609:623"/>and then more gradually till it ſunk to the Bottom of the Stem; but being removed into the Water again, it aſcended to the ſame height, the Water had before depreſſed it to.</p>
                        <p>For a further Tryal, how much Liquors may be condenſed by Cold, we took Oyl of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine rectified in a gentle Heat, and having weighed a Glaſs-ball with a long Stem, it being one Ounce, one Dram, five Grains and a half; we poured on it ſo much of the Turpentine as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the weight to, two Ounces ſeven Drams and thirty four Grains and a half; which reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little way into the Stem, we marked the Superficies with a Diamond; after which we poured a Dram more in, and ſucceſſively more; ſtill marking how high each Parcel, which was weighed exactly, rought in the Stem, till the Additional weight increaſed the former to three Ounces, one Dram, four Grains, and a half; and then taking a wide-mouth'd Glaſs with Water in it, we immerged the Weather-glaſs in the Water as before; the Veſſel in which it was contain'd being firſt encompaſs'd with Snow and Salt: When the Water began to freeze, we mark'd the Stem of the Glaſs which contain'd the Oyl at the place to which it ſubſided; and then conveying it into a Mixture of Snow and Salt, when it had ſubſided as low as it could, we mark'd the Superficies, and then remov'd it into the Air, till it roſe to it's firſt ſtation; and then we pour'd ſo much of the Oyl out into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Glaſs carefully poiſed in a pair of Scales, that the Superficies of the Oyl remain'd at the Mark which it ſubſided to in the Water; and we found that the Oyl poured off weigh'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59609:623"/>10 Grains: And ſo much more being pour'd off as made it ſtand at the Mark to which the Snow and Salt depreſs'd it, it weigh'd about as much as the former; ſo that the Oyl was Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially condenſed, ſo far, That it ſubſided as much after it had been condenſed by Cold ſtrong enough to freeze Water, as it was cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to fall by the force of that. And by divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole Proportion of Oyl, by the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Grains whoſe Bulk it ſeem'd to loſe by ſubſiding in Water, we found that it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed by the firſt degree of Cold to a 94th Part of it's Bulk and by dividing it by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional number of the Grains more, we found that the Snow and Salt had condenſed it a 47th Part of it's Bulk.</p>
                        <p>Having circumſcrib'd Water moderately Cold with a Mixture of Snow and Salt, what it ſhrunk was, if not inſenſible, inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                        <p>To meaſure the differing weight and Denſity of the ſame Proportion of Water, in the Heat of Summer and when extremely Cold; we weighed a Glaſs-Bubble in it, which was Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier than Water moderately cool, and by the Diminution of it's weight in that <hi>Medium;</hi> we found, according to the Rules of <hi>Hydroſtaticks,</hi> the weight of a Portion of Water of equal Bulk: And then weighing it in Water cool'd, by a Mixture of Snow and Salt, we were inform'd by a new Decrement of it's weight, of the weight of an equal Bulk of that Cold Water; by which we were enabl'd to make an Eſtimate of the Gravity and Denſity acquired by the Action of Gold, and by weighing the ſame Bubble in the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59609:624"/>ſame Water in hot Weather, we Learnt further how much more denſe and heavy Water mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately Cold and extremely Cold, is than warm Water. It would be of uſe to try ſuch Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as theſe in <hi>Italy,</hi> where they have the Conveniency of keeping Snow, and of freezing warm Water ſpeedily. A Glaſs-Bubble which in the Air, weighed 150 Grains being weighed in Water; on a Day not froſty, it weighed 29 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>/8 and being weighed in Water which was a little froze in a Mixture of Snow and Ice, it was not above ⅛ Part of a Grain lighter than before; ſo that the Water by Condenſation loſt not above a 230th Part of it's former Bulk. How far it may be of uſe at Sea to make ſuch Experiments as theſe, and whether they may thereby learn to know, by finding the Denſity of the Water in ſeveral Places; what Loads to carry in their ſhips and what the Water will be able to bear, I ſhall leave others to Judge: But if ſuch Experiments be try'd in ſeveral Parts; our Seal'd Weather-glaſſes, or that which contains the Pendulous drop of Water, may be of uſe; ſince they not being ſubject to be varied by the Alterations in the Atmoſphere's Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſince they may be conveniently carried from one Country to another, the different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Cold in various Regions may be better Eſtimated; a Regiſter being kept of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees the Liquor or Pendulous drop ſtood at ſuch times as the Tryals were made and where, and when expoſed to ſuch a degree as was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to freeze. To conclude this Title I ſhall add, that in making theſe Experiments, with the Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mometer
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59609:624"/>in which the Pendulous Water is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd; the Stem may, for conveniency, be held either Horizontal, upwards or Perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>

                           <note place="margin">What way or in what Line Cold acts moſt vigorouſly.</note>THAT Heat generally acts moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully on Bodies above it, and that it's Tendency is upwards, is ſelf-evident: But to diſcover in what Line Cold acts moſt vigorouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and furtheſt, we made the following Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                        <p>A Glaſs-Bubble with Water in it, having a flat Bottom, was ſuſpended within leſs than half an Inch over a Mixture of Ice and Salt, but froze not. A Bottle which contain'd a Mixture of Snow and Salt being held under Water, it was caſed with Ice, eſpecially about the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom; ſo that the Action of Cold ſeems chiefly to tend downwards.</p>
                        <p>But I rely leſs upon this Experiment, becauſe it is obſerv'd, That when a frigorifick Mixture is expoſed in a Vial, the Ice on the outſide is always oppoſite to the Mixture, not reaching higher or lower than that Mixture, above half the Breadth of a Barly-corn; and as the Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture diſſolves, and that which ſwims upon the diſſolv'd Part grows leſs and leſs, ſo Proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably the circle of Ice grows narrower on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, till the Mixture is wholly diſſolv'd, and then the Ice vaniſhes.</p>
                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:59609:625"/>
                        <p>And from an experiment ſhortly to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, <hi>viz.</hi> Eggs ſuſpended under Water, it appears, That Cold acts on every ſide, the Shells being wholly incruſtated with Ice.</p>
                        <p>To put an end to this Title, I ſhall, in order to facilitate ſome Experiments hereafter to be made, advertiſe, That whereas in common Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments Water naturally beginning to freeze at the top, and that Ice confining the ſubjacent Water, ſo that when froze it hath not room to expand; I ſay, whereas in ſuch caſes the Glaſſes are ſubject to break, to prevent ſuch ill Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences; I lay the frigorifick Mixture firſt about the bottom of the Glaſſes, by which means the Water beginning to freeze at the bottom, the Water is raiſed up above it; and as the Salt and Ice is raiſed higher about the Glaſs, ſo the Ice gradually riſes, without danger of breaking the Bottles. To this Advertiſement I ſhall add, That tho' I only at the firſt lay the mixture about the bottom of the Glaſs, yet to keep the Water a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, cool, I uſually put Ice it ſelf or Snow (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which will ſucceed in theſe Experiments) above that Mixture.</p>

                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Bodies by Cold.</note>IT is a common Tradition, That if Eggs or Apples be thawed near the Fire, it ſpoils them; but if they be immerſed in cold Water, they thaw ſlowly without dammage. To try the truth of this Tradition, I made the following Experiments.</p>
                        <p>An Egg which weighed 12 drachms and a grain, being wrapt in a wax'd Paper to defend it from the thawing Snow, was froze in a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Snow and Salt; and then wanting 4 grains of its former weight, it was put into a Baſin of Water: It acquir'd ſuch a Cruſt of Ice about it, as increaſed the weight to 15 drachms and 9 grains; and the Ice being taken off, and the Egg dryed, it weighed 12 drachms and 12 grains; being broke we found it almoſt thawed: When froze it ſwam in the Water, but when thawed it ſunk.</p>
                        <p>We took two Eggs well froze, and placing them both at an equal diſtance from the Fire, the one was put into Water and the other laid on a Table: When that in the Water was cruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over with Ice, we took it out, and breaking it, found that the Yolk and ſome part of the White were thawed; but the other Egg being cut aſunder, the White was wholly frozen, and the Yolk hard as if it had been over-boyl'd: There likewiſe appear'd in it certain concentri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59609:626"/>Circles of different Colours, and a very white Speck in the middle of it.</p>
                        <p>The ſame Experiment being tryed a ſecond time, we were confirmed in our Perſwaſion, That frozen Eggs will thaw ſooner in cold Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than in the open Air.</p>
                        <p>An Egg being ſuſpended in Water, was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with a Cruſt of Ice equally thick on all ſides.</p>
                        <p>Frozen Pippins being put into a Baſin of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, were covered over with a Cruſt of Ice of a conſiderable thickneſs; where it was obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<list>
                              <item>1. That that Part of the Pippin which was immerſed, was covered with a much thicker Cruſt than that which was above it.</item>
                              <item>2. The extant Part ſeem'd harder than the immerſed.</item>
                              <item>3. Thoſe in the Water were thawed, but one that lay out of it was much harder and more froze.</item>
                              <item>4. Neither the frozen Eggs or Apples condenſed and froze the Air, tho' they incruſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Water.</item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Eggs being froze in Snow and Salt till they crack'd, we put one into Milk, two into a Glaſs of Beer, and two more into a large Glaſs of Sack, but produced no Ice. Eggs being put into Vinegar produced no Ice; but the Vinegar cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roded the Egg-ſhells.</p>
                        <p>A Cheeſe immerſed in Water in a cold Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, was cruſted over with Ice; but lumps of Iron, pieces of Glaſs, and Stones, being kept longer in Snow and Salt than was ſufficient to freeze Eggs, produced no Ice in Water.</p>
                        <p>Water being poured into a Bottle which ſtood on the North-Eaſt ſide of our Elaborotory, Part of it was preſently turned into Ice.</p>
                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:59609:626"/>
                        <p>Ice and Juice of Pippins ſhaken together in a Vial produced a great deal of Dew, and ſo did Ice beaten into a Liquor with the White of an Egg. Pippins were much better when thaw'd in cold Water than haſtily.</p>
                        <p>It hath been obſerved in the cold Northern Climates, That when they have come out of extreme Cold too haſtily to the Fire, it hath raiſed Bliſters; wherefore it is a cuſtom amongſt the more careful ſort, to waſh their Hands, or other frozen Parts, in cold Water or Snow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they approach the Fire. I am told by one, That Cheeſes being froze in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> thoſe thaw'd in Water were cruſted over with Ice; but were much better than others thaw'd in a Stove. And <hi>Guilielmus Fabritius Hildanus, Cap.</hi> 10. <hi>de Gangraena &amp; ſphacelo,</hi> gives an Account of a Man who was ſucceſsfully thaw'd and cruſted over with Ice as our Apples and Eggs were.</p>
                        <p>Tho' a moderate degree of Cold preſerves Bodies from putrifaction; yet Glaciation leaves them more ſubject to it upon a thaw, tho' whilſt they are in that ſtate they putrifie not.</p>
                        <p>To prove that the higheſt degree of Cold un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Glaciation hinders Bodies from Corruption, I ſhall alledge the following Inſtances, <hi>Bartholinus de uſu nivis,</hi> ſays, p. 80. <hi>Regii Mutinenſes ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vem hoc fine arcte compactam ſervant, in Cellis Nivariis, in quibus fervente aeſtate vidi carnes mactatorum Animalium a Putredine diu ſe conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſſe.</hi> And Capt. <hi>James</hi> in his Journal, p. 74. hath theſe words, <hi>By the ninth of</hi> May <hi>we were come to and got up our five Barrels of Beef and Pork, and had four Buts of Beer and one of Cider</hi>— <hi>It had lain under Water all the Winter; yet we
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59609:627"/>could not perceive that it was any thing the worſe.</hi> P. 79. he farther ſays, That a <hi>Cable</hi> having lain under Ice all Winter, was not <hi>in</hi> June <hi>found a jot the worſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And from <hi>Simlerus</hi> his Account of the <hi>Alps,</hi> it appears, That entire Bodies may be preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Snow without Glaciation. <hi>Refert</hi> (ſays <hi>Bartholinus,</hi> ſpeaking of him, p. 79. <hi>de figurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis</hi>) <hi>in Rhetis apud Rinwaldios; nivium è monte ruentium moles Sylvam &amp; proceras Abietes dejeciſſe, accidiſſe etiam Helvetio Milite per Alpes iter fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciente, ut</hi> 60 <hi>homines &amp; plures eadem Nivis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>globatione opprimerentur.

Vidimus ipſi triſte hoc Spectaculum,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>To prove that inanimate Bodies whilſt froze are not ſubject to Putrifaction, I ſhall bring ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Inſtances. Nor indeed is it much wonder, ſince, whether Glaciation proceeds from intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Swarms of frigorifick Atoms, wedged in betwixt the Parts of a Body, or whether we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it to ariſe from an avolition of thoſe reſtleſs Particles which before kept the Body fluid or ſoft; we muſt ſuppoſe an unuſual reſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the concomitant cauſe of Corruption to be wanting.</p>
                        <p>But to proceed to Inſtances, I am told, That on the Coaſt of <hi>Sweeden</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> the Cold will preſerve Bodies a long time from putrifacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And <hi>Bartholinus</hi> relates a Story of ſeveral dead Bodies (p. 83. <hi>de uſu Nivis</hi>) which being kill'd in a Battel in the Winter, were froze in ſeveral Poſtures, and continued ſo without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59609:627"/>corrupted as long as the Winter laſted. To which I ſhall add, that Capt. <hi>James</hi> tells us, p. 76. of a Man whom they found froze in the Ice ſix Weeks after he had been committed to Sea, and all the alteration the Froſt had wrought on his Body, was, that his Fleſh would move up and down upon his Bones like a Glove upon a Man's Hand. And <hi>Bartholinus de uſu Nivis,</hi> Cap. 12. further tells us, That 'tis obſerved in <hi>Greenland,</hi> that the Froſt preſerves Bodies from Putrifaction 30 Years.</p>
                        <p>But tho' freezing preſerves Bodies from Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifaction for the time, yet when they thaw they preſently diſcover, that the Textures of them were impaired and vitiated all that while by the action of the Cold; for having froze an Ox-Eye, I obſerv'd, that the Chryſtalline humour, which was ſo tranſparent before, being froze, loſt its dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneity and became white. And it hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by others, That tho' Cheeſes which were thaw'd in Water, were better than thoſe that were otherwiſe freed from the Ice; yet they were all, in ſome meaſure, impaired by the Froſt.</p>
                        <p>To theſe Inſtances I ſhall add, that <hi>Purchas,</hi> Lib. 3. Cap. 5. Sect. 2 p. 493. tells us, That in <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> their ſtrong Beer being froze, was wholly vitiated, and without ſtrength or taſte. And Capt. <hi>James</hi> tells us, That ſtrong <hi>Alicant</hi> Wine, by being froze, had loſt much of its Spirits. And it hath been obſerved in the Northern Country, leſs cold than <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> That Beef having been froze, was almoſt inſipid, and yielded Broth little better than Water. Beſides which Inſtances I am inform'd, That
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59609:628"/>Bodies much harder than any yet mention'd may be work'd upon by Cold; not to mention, that it is obſerv'd, That Bones, and even Steel it ſelf, are much more ſubject to break in froſty Weather than at other times. And it is to our preſent Purpoſe, further obſervable, That Capt. <hi>James</hi> relates, that in <hi>Charlton</hi>-Iſland the Wood muſt be thaw'd before the Carpenters are able to work it.</p>
                        <p>And I am further inform'd, That the Timber of the Houſes in <hi>Moſcow</hi> will not only crack in froſty Weather; but 'tis obſerv'd, That Brick-Houſes in the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> decay much ſooner than here in <hi>England.</hi> And it hath been further obſerved, That Marbles themſelves have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flown in pieces in froſty Weather, but that Braſs-Inſtruments, and even Iron-Hoops have been crack'd by extreme Cold; as <hi>Olaus Wormius,</hi> and the Dutch-men in their Voyage to <hi>Nova Zembla</hi> witneſs. But I am apt to believe, that the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Iron-Hoops rather depended on the operation of the Cold on the Liquor contain'd in thoſe Barrels; than immediately on the Iron-Bars themſelves, and that they were broke by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion of that Liquor.</p>

                           <p>In confirmation of what hath been deliver'd before, the Ruſſian Emperor's Phyſitian told me, That if thoſe that have their Noſes or Cheeks froze, don't rub them with Snow before they go into the Stoves, they ſometimes drop off; and he likewiſe told me, That moderately weak Wine by being froze, would loſe both its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59609:628"/>and taſte. He further told me, That Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies there, will keep all the froſty Weather un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt; and that Veniſon and Beef, and other Fleſh, will be preſerved a long time by Froſt; but if it is not thawed leaſurely before it comes to be roaſted, it will be much impaired. And I am told, That a young Man having been froze all over, was recovered by being firſt rubb'd with Snow before any other means was uſed.</p>

                           <p>Fiſhes taken from under the Ice, in Lakes and Ponds which were frozen over, and packed up, would be preſerv'd a Month without being ſalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or dryed; and it was obſerv'd, That when they were taken out of the Water in the cold Air, they would be froze immediately. It was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe obſerv'd by the ſame Perſon who told me theſe things, That tho' Fleſh-meat froze was better when thaw'd leaſurely in cold Water than haſtily by the Fire, yet it acquir'd not a Cruſt of Ice about it.</p>
                           <p>In <hi>Lapland</hi> when any Part is froze, they toaſt Cheeſe made of Deer's Milk, and anoint the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Part with the <hi>Cows-body.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I had ſome <hi>Cheſhire</hi>-Cheeſes froze my ſelf, one of which being thrown into Water gather'd a Cruſt of Ice about it.</p>
                           <p>There are white Bears in <hi>Green-Land</hi> which have ſo excellent a ſcent, that when the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſs of a Whale was left at ſome diſtance from the ſhore; they would raiſe themſelves, on their Legs, and with their two Paws, would fan themſelves with the Air, and ſnuff it in at their
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59609:629"/>Snouts, and then throwing themſelves into the Sea would Swim towards the dead Carcaſſes; the fat of ſome of them would yield a Hogſhead of Oyl. In <hi>Moſcow</hi> a Hogſhead of <hi>Malaga</hi>-Sack being froze, a Spirituous Liquor diſtill'd out of it ſtronger than the Sack it ſelf; but the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor left behind it, was a ſtrengthleſs Phlegm. A Barrel of Beer being froze on the Coaſt of <hi>Green-Land,</hi> the Spirituous Part was contain'd in the middle.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Wines, that are brought to <hi>Moſcow</hi> betwixt <hi>Ruſſia</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> are ſometimes ſo frozen by the time they come there; that they are forced to break the Casks, and to tranſport it in Jars from one place to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and when they have a mind to thaw it, they put it into another Hogſhead, and that being placed in a hole made in Ice or Snow, it thaws leaſurely there without being ſo much impaired as if thawed in a Stove or by the Fire.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion of Water and other freez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Liquors.</note>THO' it hath been generally allowed, that Water and other Liquors are condenſed by Cold; yet from what I ſhall offer, it will appear, That <hi>Ice</hi> is not <hi>Water</hi> condenſed but <hi>Rarified.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For I have not only obſerv'd, That Water expoſed to be froze in a Bolt-head, would if the frigorifick Mixture inclin'd it to begin to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59609:629"/>freeze at the Bottom firſt, be expanded, ſo as to riſe conſiderably higher in the Stem, but when that Ice was thawed again will ſubſide. And to this I ſhall add, That having included Water in a Cylinder, both ends of which were ſtopped up with Wax, the Cylinder being hung up in the Air, and the Water froze; it was ſo far expanded, That it forced the Wax out of each end of the Pipe, and form'd a Rod of Ice much longer than the Cylinder; from whence it appears, That the breaking of Bottles by Cold rather depends on the Expanſion of the Included Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, than that the weight of the Air cauſed that Effect, as ſome Moderns teach; or that the Internal Liquor being condenſed by Cold, the Air breaks in to prevent a <hi>Vacuum:</hi> For that Water is expanded by Cold, appears from what I have ſaid; beſides nothing is more commonly obſerv'd, than that Water being froze in a Veſſel whoſe ſides are ſtrong enough to keep it from burſting them, the Superficies of the Ice is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally protuberant and convex. And that the breaking of Bottles depends not on Nature's abhorrency of a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> appears; ſince ſhould we ſuppoſe, That the Fluid contain'd in a Bottle would be ſo far condenſed as to poſſeſs leſs ſpace than before; it is poſſible there might be a <hi>Vacuum</hi> there, and the Bottle not burſt; ſince Glaſs-Bubbles much thinner than ordinary Bottles will endure the froſt, tho' ſtopped cloſe with Air in them.</p>
                        <p>But not only Water expands it ſelf upon freezing but other Aqueous Bodies; ſo Eggs being froze, burſt their ſhells aſunder. And Milk, Urine, <hi>Rheniſh</hi> Wine, and good Spirit
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59609:630"/>of Wine, being ſet to freeze in diſtinct Glaſs-Eggs; the Wine being froze ſwell'd an Inch above the firſt Surface, the Milk two Inches, and the Urine ſix or ſeven. And a Solution of <hi>Dantzick</hi>-Vitriol, did not only become Opace, but roſe conſiderably higher in a Cylindrical Pipe, upon Congelation.</p>
                        <p>Whether more ſtable and conſiſtent Bodies are capable of being expanded by Cold; would be worth enquiring; ſince it hath been obſerv'd, That in <hi>Nova Zembla</hi> the very Clocks have been froze ſo that they would not goe; and the like hath been obſerv'd by Capt. <hi>James</hi> in his Voyage at <hi>Charlton</hi>-Iſland; his Watch being froze as well as his Clocks. Whether theſe Effects depended on any Swelling of the Ropes, or whether the Spring of his Watch might be weakned by Cold, or whether ſome Iceicles ſtuck to the Internal Parts of it; I ſhall leave as bare Conjectures, to be further examined in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by Experience.</p>

                           <p>Having filled a Bolt-head which was as big as two <hi>Turkey</hi> Eggs with Water, till it rought, a pretty height into the ſlender Stem, being put into a Mixture of Snow and Salt, it ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a little; but when it began to freeze it would ſenſibly ſwell.</p>
                           <p>The Experiment being repeated with a Glaſs whoſe Stem was as thin as a Raven's Quill; when firſt the Ball of it was immerſed in the frigori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59609:630"/>Mixture, the Water preſently aſcended the height of a Barly-corn, and preſently ſubſided again, which the <hi>Florentine Virtuoſi</hi> would attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to a Conſtriction of the Glaſs upon the Application of the frigorifick Mixture.</p>

                              <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When the Water had ſubſided a little, it would be at a ſtand, till the Liquor began to freeze.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of Ice and its Cauſe.</note>1. IT is uſually accounted an Argument of the levity of Ice above Water, that it ſwims up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it: For tho' the ſuperficies of ſmall Portions of it are not ſenſibly emergent above the Surface of the Water; yet in <hi>Greenland,</hi> where huge Rocks of Ice float in the Sea, they are obſerv'd to be as high above the Water as the Maſts of Ships, which could we ſuppoſe to float in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Poſture, and to be of a priſmatical Form, that Part immerſed would be nine times as much as that above the Water. As for the Reaſon why Ice is born up above the ſurface of the Water ſo much in <hi>Greenland</hi> more than in our Climate; beſides that the ſize of thoſe pieces of Ice contributes to the rendring the Obſervation more remarkable, the Water's expanſion in that cold Climate may cauſe it to be further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded there than here, and conſequently light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Pieces of Ice free from Bubbles floated in Spirit of Wine drawn from Brandy, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe from Quick-lime; and tho' if that Spirit were warmed, it would preſently ſubſide, yet as it cooled, the Ice would aſcend; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſome part of it being thaw'd, the Water would ſubſide in a ſtream through the Spirit. In warm Water the Ice would ſwim; but in Oyl of Turpentine and the rectify'd Spirit of Wine it would ſink like a Stone.</p>
                        <pb n="69" facs="tcp:59609:632"/>
                        <p n="3">3. A piece of Ice which was clear from Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, for as much as we could diſcern, and very tranſparent, would not ſink in Water; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother piece, which in a Microſcope appear'd to be full of Bubbles, was nevertheleſs tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and would float on Water.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That the levity and expanſion of Ice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the number of Bubbles diſperſed through it, is unqueſtionable; but how it comes by thoſe Bubbles is a matter that deſerves our Inquiry: And tho' Mr <hi>Hobbes</hi> attributes it to the Intruſion of ſome external airy Parts, yet we obſerv'd, That Water defended from the Intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of external Air, was not without Bubbles, when froze in a Glaſs hermetically ſealed; but being expanded, the numerous Bubbles diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through it, gave it a whitiſh Opacity; and the ſame Phaenomena were afforded by Ice froze in Metalline Veſſels.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. And that the Ice froze in the hermetically ſealed Glaſs, received not its Bubbles from the Air ſhut up with it; is reaſonable to believe:

                                 <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> That the Air in the ſealed Glaſs cannot be diſperſed through the Ice, and thereby cauſe it to expand, appears; ſince oftentimes it is ſo far compreſs'd by the ſwelling Ice, that it breaks the Glaſs, which it would not do, could it be mixed with the Ice and diſperſed through the freezing Water.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59609:633"/>than Water, can dive into the bottom of it, and that too without being ſeen? <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If the Bubbles contained in Ice were deriv'd from the external Air depreſs'd through freezing Water, Ice thaw'd would yield Air enough to fill as much ſpace as the frozen Water poſſeſs'd more than the thaw'd Water.</item>

                           <item>II. Water which had been freed from Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in our Priſmatical Engine, being froze, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd few Bubbles, but being thaw'd and then pour'd into a Glaſs-Cylinder, it was powerfully expanded ſo far as to burſt the Glaſs.</item>
                           <item>III. A Glaſs-egg with a narrow Stem being filled ſo far with Water, that the ſurface of it roſe an Inch within the Stem; it was convey'd into a Receiver, and whilſt the Air was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſting, Bubbles roſe ſo plentifully, that the Liquor ſeem'd to boyl: Which when it was in a great meaſure cleared of, we placed it in a mixture of Snow and Salt; and obſerv'd, that the expanded Liquor being froze, had riſen a great way above its firſt height. When it was placed in the open Air, of ſuch a temper as
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59609:633"/>made it thaw leiſurely, we obſerv'd, That the exterior part of the Ice was full of Bubbles: But when that was diſſolv'd, the Ice in the middle was of an unuſual Texture; being void of Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and not unlike a froſted piece of Glaſs, whoſe aſpereties were very thick ſet: When the Ice was almoſt thaw'd, we convey'd the Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble into the Receiver; but tho' the Air was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, we perceiv'd not that the Ice was ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er melted; but the Water afforded a few Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and in a little time ſome few appear'd in the Ice. When the Ice was wholly thaw'd, we took the Glaſs-Bubble out of the Receiver, and found, That the Water had ſubſided to its firſt Mark, if not a little below it; ſo that the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when expanded riſing three Inches in the Stem, and the weight of the whole Water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but two ounces and a half; the Ice ſeem'd to take up about a twelfth Part more than the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>froze Water.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p n="7">7. A Cylinder of Water being immers'd in a Mixture of Ice and Salt, and that convey'd into a Receiver; we found, That when the Air was exhauſted, and the Water in a great meaſure freed from Bubbles, the ſurface of it was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably rais'd; the Water in the bottom being turn'd into Ice as far as the Mixture wrought, in which we perceiv'd, beſides a few large Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, ſmall ones enough to render it opacous.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. To ſhew, that the Bubbles perceivable in Ice are not filled with true and ſpringy Air, I ſhall ſubjoyn the following Experiment.

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59609:634"/>which riſing up into the Neck, ſtood about an Inch above the ſuperficies of the frigorifick Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which circumſcribed it; the Diameter of the Stem being large enough to receive the end of my Finger.

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59609:636"/>did before. In another Experiment 55 Parts of Water being froze, were extended to 60 ½; 6 of thoſe remaining unfroze.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Another way we took to meaſure the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion of Water, was, by marking a Cylindri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Pipe at the ſuperficies of the Water contain'd in it; which, when it was froze, was rais'd a tenth part higher than before. Another more exact Cylinder being made uſe of, we found, that Water froze expanded to about a ninth Part of the ſpace it poſſeſs'd before.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. But perhaps this Method of meaſuring the expanſion of freezing Water may ſuggeſt a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to thoſe that are acquainted with Hydroſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks: ſince <hi>Archimedes</hi> hath made it appear, as well as <hi>Stevinus, That floating Bodies will ſo far, and but ſo far, ſink in the Liquor that ſupports them, till the immerſed Part of the Body be equal to a bulk of Water, weighing as much as the whole Body.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4.

                        <p n="5">5. But to clear this difficulty I have theſe things to repreſent; Firſt, That the Ice which we take notice of, floats in freſh Water, but that obſerv'd by Navigators, being freſh floats in ſalt Water; yet this is to be likewiſe conſider'd, That near the Poles the Seas are not ſo ſalt as ours, or
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59609:636"/>thoſe under the Line, and conſequently will not be able to bear up the floating Ice ſo high; except the coldneſs of that Region recompenſes the want of Salt.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. But beſides theſe Conſiderations, that which I would chiefly inſiſt upon for the removal of this difficulty, is, That theſe huge Piles of Ice are made up of vaſt Lumps, betwixt which are large Vacuities which are only fill'd up with Air; ſo that we are not to judge of their weight by the bulk they appear to be of to the Eye; but by the ſpecifick weight incumbent on that part immers'd in the Water: For we ſee in Barges, that ſometimes they carry Loads, which conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of light Matter, may be piled a great height above the Water, without depreſſing the Veſſel ſo much as heavier Bodies of leſs bulk, which are more ponderous in <hi>Specie;</hi> for the greateſt part of theſe floating pieces of Ice, as <hi>Bartholinus</hi> takes notice, are compiled of ſtore of Snow fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen together. Beſides, it is obſerv'd, That moſt of thoſe ſtupendious Mountains which lay ſo much above Water below reſted on the Ground, ſo that probably they might have ſunk much lower, had the Water been deep enough for them; for Mr. <hi>Hudſon</hi> in his Voyage takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, in a Bay that bears his Name, of a piece of Ice ſevenſcore Fathom deep.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Having ſaid thus much of the expanſion of Water, it perhaps may be expected, that I ſhould ſay ſomething of the expanſion of aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Humours; and alſo of the degrees of the Condenſation of Water and watry Humours: But as for the firſt, I doubt whether there be any expanſion, except of the watry Parts of them; but if it may be of any uſe to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59609:637"/>direct us in making an eſtimate of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Proportions they contain of Phlegm, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more ſpirituous Ingredients; I would not diſcourage thoſe whoſe Curioſity ſhall prevail with them to proſecute ſuch Experiments. And as for the condenſation of Water by Cold, tho' perhaps in hotter Climates it may be conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet I have not found it very ſenſible in all the Tryals I have made here.</p>

And we found the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſive force of Froſt ſo ſtrong, That it burſt a Bottle, the thinneſt part of which was 1/14 of an Inch, and the thickeſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="2">2. To make a more Determinate Eſtimate of the Expanſive force of Froſt; we made uſe of a Braſs-Cylinder, to which we adapted a Plugg, which falling a little way within the Cylinder reſted upon the edges of it. The length of the Cylinder was about 5 Inches and the breadth 1 ¾ The Experiment made in this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument was by filling it full of Water and then laying 56 pound weight upon the top of it: And tho' it was a hard matter to cauſe the Mixture to freeze; yet we were at the laſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do it, and then we obſerv'd, That the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59609:638"/>Ice lifted up the one ſide of the lower ſo high, that the weight fell down; but at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time it ſucceeded ſo well, that the lower was uniformly raiſed, the breadth of a Barly-corn. Upon a gentle thaw the Superficial Parts being taken out, the Ice appear'd full of Bubbles: And in the Morning when it began to melt before the fire, the weight being taken off; ſeveral drops of Water, dilated into numerous Bubbles, iſſu'd out, like a kind of Froth.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Another way we took to meaſure the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſive force of Cold, was, by driving a Wooden Plugg ſo faſt into the end of the Braſs-Cylinder, That half a hundred weight and a quarter of a hundred, might be ſuſpended at it without pulling it out; yet in two froſty Nights the expanding Water was able to raiſe it a quarter of an Inch.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. There is one thing in theſe Tryals de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be taken notice of, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Expanſion of Air by Heat being ſufficient to make it poſſeſs 70 times it's former ſpace; yet the utmoſt degree, Water by Glaciation will extend it ſelf to, is a ninth: So that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer by Expanſion acquires 60 times the ſpace that Water does; taking <hi>Merſennus</hi> his account of the Air's Expanſion to be true, which comes ſhort of what we have ſhewn it capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Expanded to.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. We endeavoured likewiſe to meaſure the force of Waters Expanſion when congeal'd, by encloſing it in a Iron-Globe whoſe Diameter was about 3 Inches, and which had a Female Screw continued from it's Cavity to the out ſide; to which was adapted Male a ſcrew ſo cloſe,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59609:638"/>That we were forc'd to uſe a Vice to ſcrew it in; but our hopes were fruſtrated; the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pactneſs of the metal, as we ſuppos'd, keeping the Liquor from freezing.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. It would be worth while to conſider the cauſe of ſo powerful an Expanſion, ſince nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Carteſian nor the Epicurean Doctrine are able to explain this Phaenomenon: For the firſt only accounting Cold to be a Privation of Heat; and depending upon the receſs of thoſe ſubtil Parts, which he ſuppoſes Expanſion to depend on; according to him, they ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther continue an Inactive Maſs, than retain ſuch a Springyneſs. And ſince according to <hi>Epicurus,</hi> Expanſion depends on an Inſinuation of frigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifick Atoms, It may well be queſtion'd, how parts of Matter, which have ſuch a free entrance into ſuch Veſſels, ſhould not rather find as eaſie a Paſſage out again as in, without breaking them?

An Oval Glaſs about the ſize of a Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keys-egg, with a neck almoſt Cylindrical, was filled with Water within four Inches and a half, and then a piece of Paper being paſted upon the Stem divided into half Inches and quarters, and the Apex being ſealed up by a moderate Heat; the Surface of the Water was raiſed conſiderably, but the Oval Part of the Glaſs being covered with a Mixture of Ice and Snow, the Air was compreſſed into a 17th Part of the ſpace it poſſeſſed before; And the Ball of the Glaſs burſting afterwards with a conſiderable Noiſe, the Ice appeared full of Bubbles, which rendred it white and Opacous. In another Glaſs whoſe Ball was larger in proportion to the Stem, the Air was compreſſed into a 19th Part of it's former ſpace before the Glaſs flew in pieces.</item>
                           <item>3. And this way of trying how far the Air might be compreſſed and Water expanded by Cold, we thought leaſt Exceptionable; becauſe the Pores of Glaſs are more impervious to Air
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59609:640"/>and Water, than ſome Metalline Veſſels; for having broken open the Apex of the Stem of one of our Glaſs-Eggs, we found, that tho' the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was but a little expanded; yet not finding a way out at the Pores of the Glaſs, the Water roſe up a quarter of an Inch.</item>

                           <note place="margin">Of the Sphere of Activity of Cold.</note>IN eſtimating the Sphere of Activity of Cold, we are not only to conſider the Degree of it in the cold Body; but alſo the <hi>Medium</hi> through which it is to paſs, and the Conſiſtence and Texture of it; as likewiſe the Inſtruments em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd to receive or acquaint us with the Action of Cold: Since, from what hath been before laid down, it appears, That Weather-glaſſes give us a more nice account of the Degrees of it; and that our Senſories may miſ-inform us, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their various Prediſpoſitions. Beſides the Sphere of Activity may be vary'd by the Bulk of the cold Body.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. But to conſider the Sphere of Activity of ſmall Pieces of Ice; we have found it very ſmall in compariſon of the Atmoſpheres of odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Bodies; inſomuch that I am perſwaded, we can have no ſenſe of Cold, without the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Contact of a cold Body; ſince Ice ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching our Senſory, or a Weather-glaſs, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects neither; tho' held as near as poſſibly they may without touching. And the like hath been
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59609:641"/>obſerv'd at Sea, where in foggy Nights the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have not been able to diſcern neighbouring Mountains of Ice: Tho' by a Merchant who made the Obſervation in <hi>Greenland,</hi> I am told, That he perceived a manifeſt acceſs of Cold, upon the approach of a floating piece of Ice.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And I am told, that in <hi>Iſpahan</hi> the Capital City of <hi>Perſia,</hi> the Ice being never much more than a Finger thick, they uſually pour Water upon it, which as it runs over the Ice, is in part froze, by which means, they thicken the Ice, and preſerve it in proper Conſervatories. This Experiment having been tryed in <hi>England,</hi> by pumping of Water upon Flakes of Ice; I found, That the Pump-water, being warmer than the Ice, thawed it, inſtead of increaſing the Thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it. And tho' here in <hi>England,</hi> Water poured upon Snow promotes its Diſſolution, yet in <hi>Ruſſia</hi> and <hi>Muſcovy</hi> I am told, That Water thrown upon Snow freezes it; which they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make uſe of to incruſtate ſeveral Bodies with Ice; yet one thing is to be obſerv'd, that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally at the ſame time, the ſharpneſs of the Air is ſo violent, as to incruſtate ſeveral Bodies with Ice, when only Water is made uſe of; ſo that in trying ſuch Experiments, we are to conſider the Temperature of the Air at the ſame time, which hath a great Influence in promoting or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the Effects of ſuch Tryals.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. How deep Froſt penetrates into Water and Earth will be a very hard thing to determine; ſince Earth eſpecially, may be more or leſs diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to freeze, according to the ſeveral Degr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="4">4. But tho' it be ſo difficult to know to what Depth Froſt will reach, yet that we may contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute as much as we can to the general Hiſtory of Cold, we ſhall add the following Notes. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter four Nights hard Froſt the Ground in the Orchard was froze about 3 Inches deep, and in the Garden about 2; after ten Nights Froſt, the Ground in the Garden was froze about 6 Inches ½, and that in the Orchard was froze 8 ½ or more. Eight Days after, it was froze about a Foot Deep.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. A Pipe of Glaſs 18 Inches long being thruſt down into a Hole in the Ground, the Surface of the Water contained in it being level with the Earth; the next Morning the whole Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Cylinder was froze 3 Inches, from which Stick of Ice a Part of the Cylinder was froze 6 Inches deep; but the reſt of the Water remained unfroze: The Ground in the Garden, that Night was froze ten Inches deep.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. It hath been obſerv'd, that in <hi>Moſcow</hi> the Ground in a Garden was not froze above two Foot deep; but Capt. <hi>James</hi> ſays in <hi>Charlton</hi>-I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland he obſerv'd the Ground froze ten Foot deep; and the ſame Author in his Journal, p. 86. ſays, That the Water does not freeze naturally above ſix Feet.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>One Particular referrable to the XIII Title:</hi>

                        <p n="1">1. Having placed a Mixture of Snow and Salt in a Pipkin, and another in a white Baſin glazed within and without, they were both incruſtated with Ice. And that Cold will penetrate Pewter-Bottles, appears from Experiments already laid down.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Having cauſed two Cups to be made of <hi>Lattin,</hi> or Plates of Iron covered over with Tin, the Convex Part of one of which, was leſs than the Concave of the other; and the leſs having a broad Ledge, by the help of which it reſted on the Brim of the other, ſo as to leave an Interval betwixt its Convex Superficies and the Concave of the other; we filled that Interval with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and putting a Mixture of Ice and Salt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the leſs Cup, and on the outſide of the other, we had Cups of Ice made of the incloſed Water.</p>
                        <pb n="89" facs="tcp:59609:642"/>
                        <p n="2">2. The Learned <hi>Eraſmus Bartholinus</hi> in his diſcourſe <hi>De figura Nivis</hi> mentions an Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by which Air is turned into Water in the midſt of Heat, <hi>viz.</hi> Ice or Snow being put into a a funnel; which he ſuppoſes refrigerates and condenſes the Ambient Air; but I rather think, That the Dew which he ſuppoſes to be condenſed Air, is made up of moiſt Vapours ſwimming in it; which is ſo ſmall in Quantity, That having ſuſpended a Tunnel in the Air, with a Mixture of Snow and Salt; which is much more refrigerating than either Ice or Snow by themſelves, it gathered but a very ſmall Quantity, and that too laſted no longer than whilſt the Mixture was diſſolving; beſides thoſe condenſed Vapours were firſt Froze before they dropped down in the form of Water.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That in Hermetically ſealed Glaſſes, a Mixture of Snow and Salt will freeze Vapours on the outſide, is evident, from what hath been laid down; but that Cold ſhould not only penetrate Glaſs, but afterwards act upon Water in <hi>Vacuo;</hi> was a little more ſtrange: For having ſuſpended a Tube of Water in <hi>Vacuo</hi> and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Snow and Ice about it, as high as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Water wrought; it worked upon it, and Froze it from the top to the bottom.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. But what is yet more ſtrange is, That Cold will act through a evidently hot <hi>Medium;</hi> for drinking a good quantity of Mineral Waters timely in the Morning, I obſerv'd a Manifeſt Coldneſs through the Muſcles of my Abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which was in a higher degree remarkable in a Gentleman who drunk much greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities.</p>
                        <pb n="90" facs="tcp:59609:643"/>
                        <p n="5">5. To try whether the fluidity of Water depended on a Congenite motion in the Parts of it, or whether it was conveyed to it by impulſe from the Ambient Air; we provided a Glaſs-Bubble about the ſize of a Wall-nut and of a Pear like ſhape, whoſe Stem was purpoſely made crooked, and ſuſpending it by a thread in Oyl of Turpentine contain'd in a narrow Glaſs; and this being placed in a Mixture of Snow and Salt, tho' the Oyl continued fluid; yet the Water in the Bubble was froze. And when we went to take it out, the Bubble being crack'd, the greateſt Part ſubſided to the Bottom of the Mixture; but we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, That, that which was pulled out, was divided by a line through the middle from the top downwards. And it was further obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in this Tryal, That the two ſeparable Piec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Ice, being left in a Mixture of Ice and Salt for 14 hours, were very little waſted. The like ſucceſs we had with a Bubble of Water ſuſpended in Spirit of Wine; but another ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in Sea-Salt was not froze at all; nor was another that we hung in a ſharp brine: But the ſame Experiments being tryed another time; the Water was froze both in the Bubble ſuſpended in Spirit of Wine, and in that which was immerſed in the ſtrong Brine; the Bottle which contain'd the latter being crack'd, which cracks were not much unlike the lines drawn from the Pole of a Globe to the <hi>Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;</hi> reaching from the top of the Bubble down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                        <pb n="91" facs="tcp:59609:643"/>
                        <p n="6">6. A Bubble ſuſpended with Water in it, in a Glaſs immerſed in Snow and Salt, was froze, without the Intervention of any Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Concerning Ice.</note>1. THO' in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> it hath been thought ſtrange, That Water in <hi>England</hi> ſhould without any Artificial means be turned into a conſiſtent Body; yet it is related by ſome, That in <hi>Ruſſia</hi> the Ice on the contrary, is found much harder than Ours.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. To make an Eſtimate of the Coheſion of the Parts of Ice, we thought to have tryed what weight Cylindrical pieces of Ice of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Diameters would bear: But being fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in ſuch Tryals, we try'd how much weight a Plate of it placed betwixt two Iron-Bars would bear; but having not convenient weights we were forced to be content to know, That it bore a much greater weight than one could ſuppoſe it capable of.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. A peice of Ice 3 Inches long, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny broad; and about 4 of an Inch thick was laid croſs a frame; and a peice of Iron of this Figure (7) having a ſcale hung at the longer Leg, the Horizontal Leg was placed upon the middle of the Ice; and then 117 Ounces Troy-weight being put into the Scale, when the Iron had melted half the Ice through on one ſide,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59609:644"/>and a third Part of the other, the weight was able to break it. The Experiment being repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when the piece of Ice was 2 Inches and a half long, it bore 17 pound <hi>Averdupois</hi> and 48 Ounces <hi>Troy</hi>-weight, when the Iron on one ſide had melted ⅔ and on the other ½ Parts of the thickneſs of it.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Plates of Ice being laid upon a ſtool, and Bay-ſalt ſtrewed on ſome Parts of them, they promoted the melting of the Ice ſo much, That they buried themſelves in it; but the Parts thaw'd by this means, were ſo incorporated with, and froze to the ſtool, That we could not ſeparate them without knocking them in pieces: At a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother time Salt thrown upon Ice made a crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Noiſe and by a Candle-light, ſeveral Steams were obſerv'd to riſe from them, like from ſome hot Liquors: A few drops of <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortis</hi> dropped upon Plates of Ice, and Oyl of Vitriol, the latter ſooner penetrated but the former with more Noiſe as if the Ice were crack'd.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. In confirmation of what was ſaid in the Cloſe of this Title, I ſhall add the following Account of the <hi>Italian</hi> Conſervatories, ſent me by my ingenious Friend Mr. <hi>J. Evelyn:</hi>
                              <q>
                                 <p>The Snow-Pits in <hi>Italy, &amp;c.</hi> are ſunk in the moſt ſolitary and cooled Places, commonly at the Foot of ſome Mountain or elevated Ground, which may beſt protect them from the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dional or Occidental Sun; 25 Foot wide at the Orifice, and about 50 deep, is eſteemed a competent Proportion. And though this be excavated in a Conical Form, yet it is made flat at the Bottom, or Point. The Sides of the Pit are ſo joyced, that Boards may be nail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them very cloſely jointed. About a Yard from the Bottom, is fixed a ſtrong Frame or Treſle, upon which lyes a wooden Grate; the Top or Cover is double thatch'd, with Reed or Straw, upon a copped Frame or Roof; in one of the ſides whereof is a narrow Door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, hipped on like the Top of the Dormer, and thatched—</p>
                                 <p>

                                 </p>
                                 <p>They lay clean Straw upon the Grate or Wattle, ſo as to keep the Snow from running through, whilſt they beat it to a hard Cake of an icy Conſiſtence, which is near one Foot thick; upon this they make a layer of Straw, and then Snow, and Straw again; and continue S.S.S. 'till the Pit is full, and then laying Straw
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59609:647"/>or Reeds upon all, they keep the Door locked. This Grate is ſo contrived, that the Snow melting by any Accident in laying, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Seaſon of Weather, it may drain away from the Maſs, and ſink without ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnating upon it, which would accelerate the Diſſolution; and therefore the Bottom is but very ſlightly ſteened, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                                 </p>

                           <p n="2">2. And it hath been obſerv'd by the <hi>Dutch</hi>-Men in their Voyage to <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> That in <hi>June,</hi> the Sun was not powerful enough to melt Snow: And even in warmer Climates, where the Reflection of the Sun-beams is not ſo conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Snow continues unthawed all Summer; as upon the Top of the Alps, and other high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.

THO ſeveral Sects of Philoſophers have diſputed about a <hi>Primum Frigidum,</hi> ſome contending for <hi>Earth,</hi> others <hi>Water,</hi> others <hi>Air,</hi> and another Sect for <hi>Nitre;</hi> yet I am apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, That there is no ſuch thing as a <hi>Primum Frigidum,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, or Principle ſubject of Reſidence for any other Quality: For if an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe Degree of Motion amongſt the minute Parts of a Body, be ſufficient to give it the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Heat; it may be enough to render a Body cold, that that Motion is diminiſhed upon a remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of its Cauſe; ſo that it may be doubted whether Cold be a poſitive or a privative Quality.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <note place="margin">The Earth not the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum Frigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum</note>2. Indeed <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſuppoſes the Earth to be the <hi>Summum Frigidum:</hi> But we daily ſee, That it is froze by the contiguous Air communicating Cold to it, and, by the Interpoſition of another Body, may eaſily be preſerved from that. So the Salt-Works upon the Marſhes of the Iſland <hi>Xain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonge</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> are preſerved from the Dammage the Froſt would do them, by letting in Water, by Sluces, to overflow them. Beſides, were the Earth the <hi>Summum Frigidum,</hi> it might juſtly be wonder'd, why it congeals not the Water conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous to it, ſooner than Hail or Snow in the Air? Since Terrene Parts of Matter cannot be brought thither without ſome Cauſe able to ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate them, and perhaps to alter the Qualities of them. Not to mention thoſe <hi>Vulcano's</hi> which argue the Earth to abound with Subterraneal Fires; and that in ſeveral Places where there are no ſuch <hi>Vulcano's,</hi> as in deep Mines, thoſe that work there, find it very hot and troubleſome: And in deep Wells, it is obſerv'd, that the Water is ſo far from being froze, that it comes up reaking hot; which cannot be ſuppoſed to proceed from the Beams of the Sun, ſince it hath been obſerv'd by <hi>Monſieur de Claves, Livre</hi> 11. <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. That in the Southern Countries the Heat of the Sun penetrates not above ſix or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59609:648"/>Foot deep. And the ſubterraneal Parts are ſo far from being extremely Cold, That it is obſerv'd by Miners, That the lower they dig, the more Vapours, exhalations and Heat they find. And <hi>Jo. Baptiſta Morinus,</hi> witneſſes, That in Mines in <hi>Hungary</hi> four hundred fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom deep, after the deſcent of 80 fathom, it is always hot; but whether theſe may proceed from Subterraneal Fires or a Mixture of other Bodies I ſhall not determine; ſince I have ſeen Bodies actually Cold mix'd together produce Heat. And I am told, That in ſome Parts of <hi>England</hi> they dig up a Mineral, which, upon a Addition of Water only, becomes Hot; and for a like reaſon perhaps thoſe Heats in the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Mines may be cauſed: For that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Steams aſcend, is evident, ſince they have been obſerv'd in a Perpendicular Groave not only to ſtink<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>, but by their Corroſive Qualities, to corrode the wooden Ladders. And <hi>Morinus</hi> himſelf tells us, That deſcending into the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Mines at <hi>Cremnitz,</hi> the Heat increaſed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely as he deſcended; which they attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a Mine of <hi>Smaragdine</hi> Vitriol, which lay under it; of which kind of Vitriol, there is ſome, even in the Cold and Superficial Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Earth.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. But if againſt what hath been ſaid it ſhould be alledged, That by the <hi>Primum Frigidum</hi> they only mean ſome Earth Mixed with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Parts of the Terreſtrial Globe, I ſhould be glad to know, how we muſt diſcover this. But tho' I have brought theſe Arguments againſt this common received Notion; I cannot agree with <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> who thinks, that the Earth is
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59609:649"/>no more Cold than Hot: Since it being natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally a Body whoſe Parts are inclined to reſt; it, without the aſſiſtance of ſome Extrinſick A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to put it's Parts in Motion, muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently affect our Senſory with a greater degree of Coldneſs, than Air or Water, whoſe Parts are more Agitated.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. And if thoſe that argue for the Earth's being the <hi>Primum Frigidum,</hi> had only urged that it was the <hi>Summum Frigidum,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Earth the Summum Frigidum.</note> I could have more eaſily agreed with them: Since, in the Straits of <hi>Weigats,</hi> the Seas are froze; but not in the Northern Seas, nor that of <hi>Tartary;</hi> for the main Seas never freeze, but only near the Land, where it is much Colder than in the Ocean.</p>
                        <p n="5">
                           <note place="margin">Water not the Primum Frigidum.</note>5. It is the Opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and the Schools, That Water is the <hi>Primum Frigidum;</hi> but in all Waters that are Froze by Cold we always ſee, they begin at the top, where the Air is Contiguous; which argues the Air Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Water, ſince it congeals it: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if Water was the Coldeſt Body, it ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Naturally to be Froze, or to begin to freeze, rather in the middle than at the top, and rather in the main Ocean than in Gulfs, Straits and ſmall Rivers: For it is obſerv'd, That thoſe vaſt heaps of Ice that float in the Sea, and which we have ſo often mention'd, depend not on the Penetration of Cold to that depth they ſometime ſink to; but vaſt pieces of Ice being gathered together from the ſhore and ſmall Rivers, and cemented together, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs each other by their own weight; upon
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59609:649"/>which, the falling Snow, gradually increaſes their Bulk.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. But tho' I am far from taking Water to be the <hi>Primum Frigidum;</hi> yet I cannot agree with <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> who thinks it indifferent as to Heat and Cold: For except where ſome adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious cauſe Concurs, the Parts of Water being leſs Agitated than the Humors about our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory, by it, we muſt adjudge it Cold. And tho' by the Heat of the Sun the ſuperficial Parts of the Water are a little warmer; yet all <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> Unanimouſly agree, That it is Colder, at the depth of a few Fathoms. Beſides it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in warm Regions to be much warmer at Land than Sea, and thoſe Countries that lye near the Sea are generally cooler. But as Cold as it is there, they don't find, That it is able to congeal the Water, tho' at the top it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Froze.</p>
                        <p n="7">
                           <note place="margin">Air not the Primum Frigidum</note>7. By the Stoicks and many of the modern Philoſophers, the Air is looked upon to be the <hi>Primum Frigidum.</hi> Yet conſidering how great a Part of it lies under the Torrid Zone, and that it is for the moſt Part very Hot, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that Water encloſed in a Mixture of Snow and Salt will freeze at the bottom and not where it is contiguous to the Air; I ſay, conſidering theſe things, it will appear, That the Air is ſo far from being the <hi>Primum Frigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi> That it is not the <hi>Summum Frigidum.</hi> Beſides Air condenſed to the utmoſt degree it was poſſible by the Coldneſs of the Air; and ſhut up in a convenient Glaſs, hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed further by the Application of other Bodies: Whence it appears, that the Coldneſs
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59609:650"/>of the Air depends on the Mixture of ſome frigorifick Corpuſcles with it, and not on the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick Texture of it's own Parts. Beſides, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be Froze when incloſed in Subſtances not apt to freeze, and when the Air is not Contiguous to it.</p>
                        <p n="8">
                           <note place="margin">Nitre not the Grand Efficient of Cold.</note>8. The next Opinion I ſhall conſider is, <hi>That</hi> of the learned <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> who aſcribes the frigorifick Virtue of Bodies to the admixture of Nitre: But tho' I allow Nitre to be a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance diſperſed through moſt Bodies; yet, ſince Cold is only a Privative Quality and an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Heat; there are other Agents, which, by ſtopping the motion of the Inſenſible Parts of a Body, may deprive it of it's power of Heating. Beſides, it muſt be a prodigious Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Nitre, That would be able to render every Part of the Sea ſo Cold as it is found to be; rot to mention, That Nitre is ſcarce ever found ſo deep in the Earth as ſome Seas extend; beſides the Seas afford us very little Salt-Petre, but a great deal of common Salt.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. And tho' <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> aſſerts, That Bodies receive the Impreſſions of Cold, from Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Exhalations ſwimming in the Air; yet amongſt all the Experiments I have made, to reſolve Nitre into Vapours, I have not found, that it was able to effect more in the Production of Cold, than other Saline Bodies. And Spirit of Nitre is ſo far from having an actual Coldneſs greater than other Bodies, That it is potentially Hot. And whether the Exhalations of Nitre will congeal Water or not; Spirit of Nitre, I have obſerv'd, will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve Ice, as ſoon almoſt as Spirit of Wine:
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59609:650"/>And tho' Nitre mix'd with Snow or Ice may promote Congelation; yet it proves not that the Parts of Nitre are frigorifick; ſince the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment will ſucceed with Spirit of Wine.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. Having ſaid, thus much of <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> his Opinion, we ſhall in the next place, propoſe ſome Experiments; which will be a further Confirmation of what we have been ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. Rock-Petre and Ice, being put into a Bottle, congeal'd the Vapours on the outſide; but pieces of Salt-Petre laid upon Plates of Ice diſſolv'd it. Water being ſatiated with Salt-Petre, and expoſed to the Cold in a Bottle, broke it; ſeveral Chryſtals of Salt-Petre having ſhot in the Bottom of it. From theſe Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments it appears, That there are Colder Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies than Salt-Petre, and that it diſſolves Ice, and it is rather Hot than Cold in reſpect of Ice.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. On a windy and a cloudy Day, having ſuſpended a Weather-Glaſs in Water ſatiated with Salt-Petre we obſerv'd, That when it had ſtood a conſiderable time, and was raiſed by the ſtring up into the Air, the Liquor contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it was raiſed about 2 diviſions; and being again immerſed in the ſolution of Nitre, it was preſently raiſed; ſo that the Air was Colder, than the ſolution of Nitre.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. But to conclude this Title; tho' I am far from thinking Nitre to be the <hi>Summum Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidum;</hi> yet I doubt not, but that Parts of it ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the Earth in the form of Vapours, may contribute to the refrigeration of the Air. Not but that there are ſeveral other Bodies in
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59609:651"/>the Bowels of the Earth, whoſe <hi>Effluvia</hi> being mix'd with the Air and diſperſed through it, may cool the Air according to their Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as much as Nitre: Beſides, ſince common, Salt co-operates with Snow in the Production of Ice as well as Salt-Petre, and according to <hi>Democritus,</hi> hath Parts of a Cubical figure, which he aſſigns to Cold Atoms: And ſince <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> obſerves, That Salt-Petre conſiſts of Parts not altogether ſo apt for the production of Cold; theſe Figures being not Pyramidal but Priſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; I ſay, ſince theſe Circumſtances all concur, I ſee no reaſon, why common Salt may not be numbred amongſt thoſe Bodies, that are apt to produce Cold.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. Nay, ſometimes it may happen, That more violent degrees of Cold may be cauſed by a like Coalition of ſeveral ſorts of Salts. So the Coldneſs of Snow is advanced by a Mixture of Nitre or common Salt, or other appropriated Additaments. But I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, That it is a doubt with me, whether Cold depends on any ſuch ſaline Exhalations, or the Effects of frigorifick Atoms; but to paſs by this Scruple at preſent without any further Notice: I ſhall add, that what I have ſaid upon this Title is not ſo much to confute what Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions I have mention'd, as to ſhew, that they are <hi>Doubtful.</hi>

THO' <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> and ſeveral others aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, That the Air is Indifferent as to Cold and Heat; yet ſince Cold is only a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Quality, and ſince the Parts of the Air, are of themſelves in a leſs degree of Agitation, than the Humors about our Senſory; I ſee no reaſon why it ſhould not be eſteemed Cold: For notwithſtanding it may acquire a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable degree of Heat by the adventitious Effects of the Sun-Beams, or fire; yet we ſee, that it naturally tends to coolneſs it ſelf again. And as for the Coldneſs of the Air, tho' I deny not but that frigorifick Atoms may be mixed with it; yet I judge them not abſolutely or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together requiſite to the Production of Cold; ſince a bare Diminution of the motion of it's Parts, is ſufficient to produce ſuch a Quality in higher or more remiſs degrees.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But the Principal intent of this Section being to produce Experiments and Obſervations;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59609:652"/>I ſhall begin with the former. A ſealed Weather-Glaſs with Spirit of Wine in it, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed in a Cylindrical Receiver, when the Air in the Receiver was exhauſted, it ſubſided the length of a Barly-corn; but roſe again when the Air was let in again; which Effects I attributed to the Expanſion of the Included Air, when the External was drawn out. When the Air was drawn out of the Receiver, hot Bodies Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally applyed, affected not the Weather-Glaſs; but when the Air was let in again they cauſed the Spirit to riſe ſenſibly.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. To meaſure the Condenſation of the Air by Cold, we made the following Experiments. And, Firſt we encloſed Air in Weather-glaſſes hermetically ſealed; which, when it was artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially or naturally refrigerated, and the Apex of the Weather-glaſs broke open, we could not diſcern, by the Water it received, that it was condenſed above a 30th Part of it's former di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions. A Glaſs-egg being inverted into Salt Water, in a Cold Night, the Air was ſo far condenſed in it, That the Water roſe five Inches in the Stem. And <hi>Jan.</hi> 29 the Air ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended into 2057 Spaces was in a froſty Night contracted to 1965 Spaces. So that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree of Condenſation we could obſerve was a 22 Part and a little above a third. But a Mixture of Snow and Salt being applied to the Elliptical Part of the Glaſs, the Water roſe 4 Inches higher than in the former Experiment; and the Air was contracted from 1965 Spaces to 1860; ſo that the Artificial Cold contracted is more in reſpect of the Contraction, which the natural Cold produced, than That Condenſation
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59609:652"/>was in Proportion to it's natural temper or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a moderate degree of Coldneſs.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. But to proceed to Obſervations: Cold may hinder the Operation of the Sun upon the Air in the middle of Summer; and I am told, That it hath been obſerved to Snow in <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> all Mid-ſummer Night, and in the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Parts of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> it hath been obſerved, That ſevere Froſts happened in the cloſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt.</hi> And further, Capt. <hi>Weymouth</hi> ſays, That in the midſt of Summer, when they ſailed not near the Latitude of <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſails and Tackling were froze: To which we ſhall add, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> when they were ſailing to <hi>Cherry</hi>-Iſland, which lyes betwixt 74 and 75 degrees Latitude; in <hi>July</hi> it froze ſo hard, that the Ice hung upon their Cloaths.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. As for the degrees of Cold in the Air, Dr. <hi>Fletcher</hi> tells us, that in <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> if they go out of a warm Room into the Cold, it makes them Breath with difficulty. It is obſerv'd at <hi>Moſcow,</hi> That Water thrown up into the Air falls down congealed, the Air is ſo Cold; and at <hi>Smolensko</hi> in <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> the Spittle freezes before it can fall from one's Mouth to the Ground.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. I have obſerv'd the Air grows ſenſibly heavier, in froſty Weather; but whether it depends on any frigorifick Atoms diſperſed through the Air, or not, I ſhall leave to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by further Tryals. In Northern Countries it is obſerv'd, That foggy Weather preſently vaniſhes when Froſt begins; the moiſt Vapours being, by that, condenſed and precipitated, and the Surface of the Earth ſo cloſed up, that other Vapours were repreſſed, and kept from riſing;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59609:653"/>and the Air hath been by ſeveral obſerv'd to have been much more clear in the Winter, here in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Sweedland,</hi> and elſewhere, than at other times.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. The Refraction of Luminaries in the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Air in <hi>Nova Zembla</hi> is ſo great, that the <hi>Dutch-Men</hi> obſerv'd the Sun to appear to them 14 Days ſooner than it ought to have done. And Capt. <hi>James</hi> tells us, That he obſerv'd the Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of <hi>Charlton</hi>-Iſland to vary 52 Minutes, and the Sun to riſe 20 Minutes ſooner than it ought to riſe: Beſides ſeveral Inſtances of Refraction, laid down in the Hiſtory of the Air.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. To what we have ſaid, of the Coldneſs of the Air; we ſhall ſubjoyn the Relations and Obſervations of Navigators, which we ſhall either propoſe as promiſcuous, or in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the three following Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>That the greater or leſſer Coldneſs of the Air in ſeveral Climates and Countries, is nothing near ſo regularly proportionate to their Reſpective diſtances, from the Pole or their Vicinity to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator as Men are wont to preſume.</hi> It hath been obſerv'd, That of Places of an equal diſtance from the Northern and Southern Poles, thoſe near the latter are Colder. Tho' in <hi>Moſcow,</hi> the Cold is almoſt intolerable; yet in <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> which is a degree more Northwards, the Air is temperate enough, and the Snow ſeldom lies on the Ground. Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> in his Northern Voyage tells us, That it did not freeze near ſo hard near the 79th degree as in the 73d. And tho' <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> lies near 4, 5 and 6 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees more Southerly from the Pole than <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                           <pb n="111" facs="tcp:59609:653"/>yet the latter hath Graſs and Trees and ſuch Beaſts as feed upon them; whereas in <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va Zembla</hi> there is no Graſs and only ſuch Beaſts as feed on Fleſh. To which I ſhall add, That <hi>Joſephus Acoſta</hi> tells us, That under the Line, when the Sun was in the <hi>Zenith</hi> and juſt entred into Aries, in <hi>March,</hi> he felt himſelf ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Cold; and he likewiſe tells us, That under the Burning Zone in <hi>Quitto</hi> and the Plains of <hi>Peru</hi> the Air is temperate; at <hi>Potofi</hi> very Cold; and in <hi>Aethiopia, Braſile</hi> and the <hi>Moluccoes</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Hot. And he obſerves further, That Snow lyes on the tops of the Hills, and that it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely Cold, when the Sun is for their <hi>Zenith</hi> under the <hi>Line.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hudſon</hi> in his Voyage hath obſerved, That one Day, they were much diſturbed with Ice; and that the next Day, it was very Hot: And we are further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by <hi>Acoſta,</hi> That tho' the Seas of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zambigus</hi> and <hi>Ormus</hi> in the Eaſt, and <hi>Panama</hi> in the Weſt, are very Hot; yet that of <hi>Peru</hi> of the ſame height is very Cold. And Capt. <hi>James</hi>'s Obſerves, That tho' <hi>Charlton</hi>-Iſland is Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> yet is it of the ſame La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude with <hi>Cambridge.</hi> To which I ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn, That an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Navigator tells us, That tho' <hi>Puſtozera</hi> in <hi>Ruſſia</hi> is 68 ½ degrees, yet it is well inhabited, and a Town of great Trade. And in <hi>Hudſon's</hi> Voyage it was obſerved, that beyond 80 degrees they found it moderately warm.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The next Obſervation is, <hi>That the degree both of Heat and Cold in the Air may be much greater in the ſame Climate, and the ſame Place,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59609:654"/>at ſeveral ſeaſons of the year, or even at ſeveral times of the ſame Day, than moſt Men would believe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In Proof of this Propoſition we ſhall produce the following Teſtimonies of Travellers and of Navigators. And 1. That there is a great variety Weather in <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> Dr. <hi>Fletcher</hi> witneſſes, who obſerves, that tho' all Winter the Ground is covered with Snow and the Fields frozen up; yet the Fields in the Summer are covered with flowers and filled with the delightful noiſe of Birds; and then the Weather is as much too Hot, as it was before Cold; <hi>June, July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt</hi> being warmer than the Summer in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> And the like is confirmed by the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of others, amongſt whom <hi>Olearius</hi> tells us, that at <hi>Moſcow</hi> he ſaw Melons of 40 Pound weight better than thoſe in <hi>Italy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And at <hi>Pequin,</hi> the Royal City of <hi>China,</hi> tho' it is but 42 degrees Latitude; yet in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Martinius</hi> the Jeſuit tells, us it is a hard froſt for four Months together, ſo that all the Rivers are froze up. And <hi>Proſper Alpinus</hi> tells us, that Grand <hi>Cairo,</hi> which is only 6 degrees from the Tropick of <hi>Cancer,</hi> tho' the Summers are inſupportably Hot; yet the Winters are conſiderably Cold: And one thing he there takes notice of is, That in that Place they are ſeldom or never troubled with Diſtillations or Rheums. And <hi>Purchaſe</hi> tells us, That in <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> one Day will be extremely Cold and the next as violent Hot; ſo that at Mid-night <hi>Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co</hi> may be lighted at the Sun-beams, by the help of a Glaſs: To which Relations I ſhall add, That Capt. <hi>James</hi> tells us, That in <hi>Charlton</hi>-Iſland,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59609:654"/>tho' the Winter was exceſſive Cold; yet in <hi>June</hi> it was ſo Hot, with Thunder and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, That the Men were forced to go a ſhore to cool themſelves in the Water.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Alpinus</hi> tells us likewiſe, that in <hi>Aegypt</hi> the Air is ſome part of the Day extremely Hot and at other times very temperate and cool. And <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learius</hi> tells us, That travelling over Mount <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> in <hi>Perſia;</hi> tho' it was too Hot in the Day for them to proceed in their Journey; yet at Night they were ſo benummed with the Cold, That they were ſcarce able to light off their Horſes; and the ſame Traveller obſerv'd at <hi>Fallu</hi> in <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> both Lightning and Thunder, Winds, Snow, Rain and Ice, in one Night. And in <hi>Charlton</hi>-Iſland tho' the Heat of the Sun in <hi>June</hi> be inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable in the Day; yet at Night, the Cold is ſtrong enough to freeze Water, in Veſſels, an Inch thick.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The third Obſervation is, <hi>That in many Places the Temperature of the Air, as to Cold and Heat, ſeems not to depend ſo much on the Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Pole, as upon the Nature and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Winds that Blow there.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is commonly known, That in this Part of the World, Northerly and North-eaſterly Winds are accompained with Cold, and in Winter with Froſt: But I once obſerv'd here in <hi>England</hi> a South-Wind when it froze hard; and Capt. <hi>James</hi> in his Voyage hath obſerv'd the like: And <hi>Proſper Alpinus</hi> obſerves in <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> That the North-Winds are extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cooling; and that upon the Blowing of the <hi>Aeteſian</hi> Winds the Plague ceaſes, at Grand <hi>Cairo.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="114" facs="tcp:59609:655"/>
                        <p>That this cooling Quality depends on the changes it receives from the Places it paſſes over, is highly probable, as well as that it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires other Qualities the like way. <hi>Acoſta</hi> Lib. 3. Cap. 9. Takes notice of Winds, That, in ſome Parts of the <hi>Indies,</hi> ſo corrode Iron-gates, That they will crumble away in one's Fingers. And the ſame Author tells us, That tho' in <hi>Spain</hi> an Eaſterly-wind is Hot and troubles one; yet in <hi>Murria,</hi> it is Cold and healthful; but in <hi>Carthagena</hi> not far from the former Place, it is troubleſome and unhealth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. The <hi>Meridional</hi> (which they of the Ocean call South, and thoſe of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, <hi>Mezzo Giorno</hi>) is commonly Rainy and Boyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; and in the ſame City, I ſpeak of, it is wholeſome and pleaſant. And in <hi>Peru,</hi> he ſays, the South and South-weſt-winds are very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
                        <p>How the Winds come by theſe Qualities I ſhall not now diſpute; but to give ſome light into the matter I ſhall propoſe the following Experiment.</p>
                        <p>Setting a Weather-Glaſs with a flat Baſis up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Board, and Blowing ſeveral times upon it with a large pair of Bellows, tho' the Air ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Cold to my Hand; yet the Pendulous drop aſcended a little, the Air being a little heated in the Bellows: But if the Clack of the Bellows was ſo faſtned, That the Air muſt wholly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in at the Noſe of it; the ſtream of Air, which was by that means drawn toward the Weather-Glaſs from the Window, being cooler, would cauſe the Bubble to ſubſide.</p>
                        <pb n="115" facs="tcp:59609:655"/>
                        <p>But having provided ſuch a Tile as they lay on the ridges of Houſes and filled the hollow ſide with a Mixture of Snow and Salt, and Part of that Mixture being placed about the Bellows; I found, That the Air blown upon my Hand was, by that means, highly refrigerated: And this Air be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blown upon the Ball of a common Weather-Glaſs, the Water manifeſtly aſcended; but ſubſided again, when we left off blowing. But to proſecute the Tryal, we drew back the Noſe of the Bellows, and upon that, the Wind blowing along that Cavity upon the Weather-Glaſs, manifeſted a higher degree of Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                        <p>But tho' it from hence appears, That frigori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Atoms may refrigerate the Air; yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not, that all Winds muſt neceſſarily be cooled ſo; ſince the Cold Air near the Poles ſwimming upon that which fills the lower Part of the Atmoſphere, may, for want of a Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sun-Beams, be ſo Cold, as to cool the Air ſuddenly, when by the falling of Rain it is beat down upon us: For <hi>Acoſta</hi> hath obſerv'd, upon Mountains higher than the Alps, That the Air was extremely Cold. And the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> who failed within 17 degrees of the Pole obſerv'd, That their Cold Winds were chiefly Northerly and North-eaſterly. But,</p>
                        <p>To conclude this Title, I ſhall add an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or two to ſhew, That Cold Winds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not ſo much their Qualities from the Quarters from whence they Blow, as from the Regions over which they paſs. For Mr. <hi>Wood</hi> tells us, That tho' in <hi>England</hi> the moſt troubleſome and unwholeſome Winds
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59609:656"/>came from the Sea; yet in <hi>New-England</hi> thoſe are the moſt wholeſome: Becauſe the North-eaſt-wind coming from the Sea thaws the Ice and melts the Snow; but the North-weſt-wind coming over the Land cauſes Cold. And Capt. <hi>James</hi> obſerv'd the like in <hi>Charlton</hi>-Iſland, <hi>viz.</hi> That the South-wind was Coldeſt which came over a frozen Tract of Land.</p>
                        <list>
                           <head>Particulars referrable to the XVIII Title.</head>
                           <item>1. The little ſealed Weather-Glaſs being immerſed in Water, contained in a Glaſs-Vial greaſed in the inſide, when the Water was froze, and the Ball of the Weather-Glaſs was incruſtated, being taken out, the Ice was broke off: Upon which the Tinged Liquor immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately roſe in the ſhank of the Weather-Glaſs; but preſently ſubſided again below the former Mark; from whence it appears, That the Air may communicate a greater degree of Cold than Ice it ſelf.</item>
                           <item>2. Having placed a Weather-Glaſs, made by the Standard at <hi>Greſham</hi>-College, in a Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, where Beer continued unfroze in a very ſharp Winter; laſt Night and this Morning the Tinged Liquor ſtood 2 Diviſions and ⅛ above the freezing Mark; but being removed into the Garden, it ſubſided to the freezing Mark: But tho' the Cellar was warmer than the Air; yet it was not ſo warm as my Chamber; the Weather-Glaſs there ſtanding two Inches above the freezing Mark, in the Morning before the fire was made; and in the Summer the Tinged
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59609:656"/>Spirit aſcended to the 8th 9th and ſometimes almoſt to the tenth Mark.</item>
                           <item>3. The laſt Night being rendered very Cold by Snow, Froſt and Wind; this Morning, the Weather-Glaſs being removed into the Garden, the Tinged Spirit ſubſided two Diviſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the freezing Mark: Yet the Cellar did not become ſo much Hotter, by an <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>; but that Oyl of Aniſeeds continued undiſſolv'd in it till, the next Morning, tho' the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate warmth of Spring or <hi>Autumn</hi> is ſufficient to keep it fluid.</item>
                           <item>4. A Weather-Glaſs being held in the Stream of Water as it came reaking Hot out of the Pump, the Liquor ſubſided conſiderably; and being carried to my Chamber, the Air there being Colder than the Water, it was depreſſed lower.</item>
                           <item>5. Having held a Weather-Glaſs in the reaking ſtream of Pump-Water, the Spirit roſe about 5 Inches higher than it did at a Well in <hi>Oxford;</hi> and being in ſome meaſure immerſed in a Spring that uſually ſmoaks in the Winter, it was raiſed a little higher. And the Weather-Glaſs being placed on the North ſide of the Houſe about Noon, I found that the temper of the Air then, was much the ſame with the temper of the ſmoaking Spring.</item>
                           <item>6. <hi>Feb.</hi> 19. The Froſt having continued 3 Days, the Spirit was raiſed as high, by the warmth of the Spring as it uſed to be. The next Day the Spring beginning to ſmoak, the warmth of the Water raiſed the Spirit near a quarter of an Inch higher than it uſed to riſe at the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59609:657"/>Spring-head ſome Months ago. And the Water was then much warmer than the Air, for the Spirit when brought to my Chamber ſubſided; the Ground without being covered with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Snow</item>
                           <item>7. A Gentleman told me, That he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd the Tinged Spirit ſometimes higher, when it was froſty, than when it was not. And he further told me, That the Weather-Glaſs being left in Water till it was froze, when it was cleared of the Ice and expoſed to the Air, the Spirit manifeſty ſubſided. The ſize of the Ball of this Weather-Glaſs was as big as that of a large Crab, and the Stem was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 2 foot and ½ long. And the diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſtation which the Spirit reſted at in the Water and the Air was above three Inches.</item>

                           <p n="1">1. In froſty clear Weather, he obſerv'd the Sun and two <hi>Parhelions</hi> one Eaſtward and the other Weſtward; betwixt ten and twelve a Clock; and when the Sun-ſhine appeared it was full of glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Particles of Ice.</p>

A <hi>Dutch</hi> and a <hi>Scotch</hi> Ship having ſailed beyond <hi>Greenland,</hi> within one degree of the Pole, they obſerved, That tho' there were vaſt Regions of Ice near the ſhores; yet near the Pole, the Sea was open and free enough.

                           <note place="margin">Of the ſtrange Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Cold.</note>THE <hi>Dutch</hi> tell us, That they found it ſo Cold in <hi>Nova Zembla</hi> that when their Sheets were waſhed and hung to dry by a fire, one ſide would freeze as the other thawed, and that they themſelves were ſo Cold, That they could not warm themſelves by the fire; for they uſually ſmelt their ſtockings burn, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were ſenſible of the Heat. And Capt. <hi>James</hi> tells us, That in <hi>Charlton</hi>-Iſland, the one ſide of Water in a Veſſel froze, whilſt the other was next the fire. To theſe Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I ſhall add, That <hi>Marcus Polus</hi> was told, That on a Plain, which was betwixt two of the higheſt Hills in the World; fire would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther burn ſo briskly, nor boil things ſo effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually as in other Places; which I am the more unwilling to reject as impoſſible: Becauſe if Snow and Ice owe their Coldneſs to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which reigns in the Air, Nature may make
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59609:658"/>the Air as Cold in any other Northern Climates; Saline Expirations being every where diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the Earth and Sea. And this Cold is ſo violent, that Water being poured on a ſtool and a Tankard placed upon it; by a Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Snow and Salt, the Tankard will be ſo frozen to the ſtool, That the one being lift up, raiſes the other along with it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Gerat de Veer,</hi> ſays, That if they put a Nail into their Mouth it would be froze, and bring Blood along with it when taken away. And Dr. <hi>Fletcher</hi> tells us, That in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> if one hold a Pot in ones Hand; being froze to it, it will pull off the skin at Parting. And in <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va Zembla,</hi> it hath been obſerved to be ſo Cold, That it froze Salt Water two Inches thick.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. In the Market-Place at <hi>Moſcow, Olearius</hi> tells us, That the extreme Cold cauſed a Clift a foot broad and ſeveral Inches long; and that conſiderable Clifts will be made by the Cold, I am inform'd by others: And the <hi>Dutch</hi> in <hi>Nova Zembla</hi> acquaint us, That the Ground was ſo froze, that they were not able to thaw it by burning Wood upon it.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. As for the Effects of Cold on compound Bodies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That it will freeze Beer, Ale, Vinegar, Oyl, common Wine, and even Sack and <hi>Alicant</hi> we have already ſhewn; and that it hath conſiderable Effects on Wood, Bricks, Stone, Veſſels of Glaſs, Earth, and even Pew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Iron themſelves. To which I ſhall add, That tho' Cold preſerves ſome Plants; yet an exceſſive degree of it deſtroys them.</p>
                        <pb n="122" facs="tcp:59609:659"/>
                        <p n="5">5. Capt. <hi>James</hi> tells us, That he found the Cold when at the higheſt degree inſupportable; and <hi>Olearius</hi> acquaints us, that ſometimes the Cold in <hi>Muſcovy</hi> is ſo exceſſive, That neither motion nor Cloaths reſiſt the ill Effects of it; but in <hi>Moſcow</hi> the Air is very good and healthly, the Plague very ſeldom happening there. And Dr. <hi>Fletcher</hi> tells us, That in <hi>Ruſſia</hi> it is ſo Cold ſometimes, That People fall Dead in the Streets, and that the Bears and Wolves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade and Plunder the Towns in whole Troops. And the Effects of Cold have been found ſo ſtrange ſometimes, That it hath cauſed Bliſters to riſe, not only upon the Hands and Face but their Arms and Legs: Beſides theſe Inſtances, Capt. <hi>James</hi> tells us, That their Cloaths would be covered over with Froſt, and Iceicles would ſo hang to their Hair, That he was forced to ſhave his Head and Face, that they might have nothing to hang at. And <hi>Purchas</hi> ſays, That their very ſhoes would be covered over with a Hoar-Froſt on the inſide, ſo that they were not able to wear them. And I am told, That an Army of 40000 of the <hi>Turks</hi> all periſhed at once by exceſſive Cold. I am alſo inform'd, That a Province of <hi>Poland,</hi> of the ſame height of the Pole with <hi>Normandy,</hi> is ſubject to ſome ſort of Colds, which occaſion a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar kind of Sickneſs and at other times Death. And Cancerous Sores are as fatal as thoſe cauſed by Hot corroding Humours; and thoſe that dye of the Cold, either are ſeized with a drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zineſs and Coldneſs of the Extreme Parts, and dye in a ſleep, or having their Guts and Reins firſt froze and then Gangre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59609:659"/>and Mortified, vomit every thing they take, and then languiſh with violent pain and Dye; and their Bodies being opened, their Guts are black, and as if it were glewed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. What effects Cold hath upon other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, hath not been much obſerv'd by Authors: But a <hi>French</hi> Author tells us, That the Cold in <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krain</hi> as the <hi>Polanders</hi> call it, is ſometimes ſo great, That it deſtroys Horſes and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tame Beaſts. And the ſame Author men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions a four-footed Creature, called <hi>Bohack,</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to that Province, one of which being dug out of the Ground where he was froze, (for they uſually hide themſelves there in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) when they were about to flea him, the ſenſe of Pain recovered him; and this was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a <hi>Poliſh</hi> Lord from whom I had the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. It is reported, That in the Northern Countries, the Birds and wild Beaſts are uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turned white: But tho' I don't wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it as falſe; yet I cannot believe it univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally true. But this is certain, That good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors mention, white Bears and Foxes in <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va Zembla,</hi> and white Partridges upon the Snowy Alps; and I have heard of white Pheaſants in <hi>Savoy.</hi> What may be the Reaſon of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour I ſhall not diſpute, nor ſhall I determine, whether it be cauſed by any ſeminal Impreſſions, or the Imagination of the Females, who have Snow always as an Object before them: But that all Beaſts and Fowls in the Northern Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates are of that white colour I find is a Miſtake; for I have ſeen Deers skins brought from <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
                           <pb n="124" facs="tcp:59609:660"/>of a Dun colour. Yet one thing which is very ſtrange is, That in <hi>Greenland</hi> and <hi>Livonia</hi> Hares become white in the Winter, and return to their Natural colour again in the Summer. And Capt. <hi>James</hi> tells us, of Foxes in <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> which are pied black and white.</p>

                           <item>1. Lieutenant <hi>G. Drummon</hi> told me, That at <hi>Smolenſco,</hi> the Barrels of Beer, being frozen a conſiderable thickneſs; the Liquor contained within was much ſtronger.</item>
                           <item>2. Two <hi>Swediſh</hi> Ambaſſadors confirmed to me, That the Hares in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> change from their Natural colour to white in the Winter, and recover their own colour in the Summer; and that on one ſide the River <hi>Duna</hi> which ſeparates <hi>Livonia</hi> and <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> the Hares are white, and on the other ſide of ordinary colours.</item>
                           <item>3. It is obſerv'd in <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> That if a Man, touches his Tongue with the Metalline Head of a Cane, it freezes his tongue immediately; ſo that he cannot ſeparate it without much Pain: For the Parts of the Metal being at reſt, and the Spittle whoſe Parts are in a weak Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſtriking againſt the Metalline Body, are wholly deprived of it, and conſequently freeze. So in a Billiard-Table one Bowl in Motion ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king againſt another not in Motion, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates as much of it's Motion as it can to the other, and loſes it's own; and ſo the Vapours and ſteams in a Room, in froſty Weather ſtriking againſt the Glaſs-Windows, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59609:660"/>of their Motion and froze, which is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to be much thicker upon the Glaſs in <hi>Ruſſia</hi> than here in <hi>England.</hi>

                        <p>This Author tells us, That at <hi>Peking,</hi> tho' the Pole be not elevated above 42 degrees; yet for four Months together, from the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of <hi>November,</hi> the Rivers are froze in one Day, ſo that they bear Coaches and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The Cold is ſo violent in theſe Countries ſometimes, That the Trees wither at the Roots, and Water is froze as it falls through the Air; and the Waters are froze up for two Months, ſo that they bear Horſes loaden, and Coaches. And this Author tells us, That he paſſed over the <hi>Weiſell</hi> in <hi>Maſſovia</hi> with a Coach and Horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and other Horſe-Men. And in <hi>Pruſſia</hi> the Fiſhing in the Ice began after the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> and laſted till <hi>March</hi> was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Another Note out of the ſame.</hi>

                        <p n="1">1. They catch Fiſh more commodiouſly in Winter than Summer; for breaking holes in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Places in the Ice, a Net being caſt into one of them, and ropes faſtned to it, Men with
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59609:661"/>Poles, and Horſes, draw the Net from one Place to another.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. I am told that at <hi>Warſaw,</hi> in twelve Hours the Water was froze 4 Inches downwards. One that ſailed to make Diſcoveries beyond the Arct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick Circle, told me, He could eat as much in one Day, as in ten here; and that after they had ſailed over a deep blew Sea, they came to one as black as Ink, which being ſounded, it was above 70 Fathom. Sack being froze, and thaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again, preſently loſt its Vigour.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. In theſe Parts the Froſt penetrates the Ground five Foot; and the Ice in <hi>Iberia</hi> in the River <hi>Ob,</hi> is ſaid to be a Fathom and a half thick; there being there but twelve Weeks in the whole Year without Froſt: The Rivers have breathing places a Mile long, out of which Fumes aſcend, as out of a Cellar, when the Door is open'd. Death by Cold is not painful, if it be intenſe. Cold dries exceſſively, cleaves the Earth, and cauſes Timber to crack.</p>

                           <note place="margin">The Weight of Bodies frozen and unfrozen.</note>1. TO try whether Bodies upon freezing would grow heavier, ſince <hi>Epicurus</hi> and other Atomiſts, ſuppoſe Congelation to depend upon the crowding in of frigorifick Atoms; we expoſed Eggs to be froze all Night, and in the Morning we found they had loſt four Grains of their Weight, which we ſuſpected to proceed
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59609:661"/>from the Avolition of ſome Exhalations through the Shell; ſince at other times we obſerv'd, That Eggs counterpoiſed loſt eight Grains of their Weight, in ſome proceſs of Time.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Water froze and weighed, counterpois'd a Grain and a little more, than when it was thawed: But the Experiment being made in a Glaſs with a long Stem, hermetically ſeal'd when the Water was froze; it was as heavy or heavier after it was thawed; and the ſame Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Weight betwixt frozen and unfrozen Water, happened in other Experiments.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Stones being weighed after expoſed to the cold Air, and alſo in a warm Air, they ſeemed to diſcover an Increaſe of Weight; but I ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted it proceeded from Water imbibed into their Pores, ſince Stones are obſerv'd to increaſe their Weight in Water: And further, becauſe one that was well poliſhed, and not apt to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibe Water, retain'd barely its own Weight. So that the Doctrine of the <hi>Epicurean</hi> Freezing, muſt be invalid, except he ſuppoſes the frigori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Atoms, like thoſe of a Load-ſtone, to be without Weight.</p>

                        <p>The fore-going Experiments, may not only ſatisfie us, That the Doctrine of the <hi>Epicureans</hi> is erroneous, but may likewiſe help us to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect ſome extravagant Relations, on the other Hand: For <hi>Helmont</hi> tells us, That Water thaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Veſſel Hermetically ſealed, was ⅛ heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than before. But perhaps this Difference might in part depend on the Acceſs of Vapors
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59609:662"/>on the outſide the Glaſs. In oppoſition to what <hi>Manalphus</hi> tells us, I found, That Water froze in a Metalline Porringer, in one Experiment loſt 50, in another 60 Grains of its Weight; which I attributed to an Avolition of ſome Parts of the Water, ſince when we order'd the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo, that no Water could ſteam out, there was no conſiderable Increaſe or Decreaſe in the Weight of Water froze or thawed.</p>

Quick-ſilver being weighed in the Air, and afterwards counterpoiſed in Water, when by the application of a Mixture of Snow and Salt, it began to freeze; the Bubble weighed ¾ of a Grain leſs than before.

                              <hi>Bartholinus</hi> citeing an Experiment, wherein the Proportion betwixt Nitre and Water was 35 to 100; to try the ſucceſs of it, we mixed a Pound of Salt-Petre with 3 Pounds of Water, and ſtirring it about conſtantly, as <hi>Cabaeus</hi> directs, in an Hour and half we perceived not the leaſt Ice; whereas, according to him, it ought to have been wholly froze in leſs time; but we could not perceive the Vapours on the outſide of the Glaſs in the leaſt froze.</p>
                           <p>For a further Tryal, we mixed two Ounces of Salt-Petre with ſix of Water in a Glaſs-Vial, but by all the ſhaking we could not produce the leaſt Ice; tho' whilſt the Nitre was diſſolving the Mixture was ſenſibly colder; and the ſame we have obſerv'd to happen upon a Diſſolution of Common Salt; tho' the Degree of Cold was not ſufficient for Congelation, which I was ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed in, by removing a Thermoſcope out of the Mixture of Nitre and Water, into Water which was placed in Snow and Salt: For by that means the Liquor in the Weather-Glaſs ſubſided in the latter about 3 Inches; ſo that I am apt to think
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59609:664"/>the Learned <hi>Cabaeus</hi> miſtook Chryſtals of Nitre for Ice.</p>
                           <p>It is believed by moſt Water-men, That the Water begins to freeze at the bottom, becauſe they obſerve large Pieces of Ice riſe from the bottom of the Water: But the Truth of it is very reaſonably queſtion'd, ſince we not only ſee, that Water in Veſſels, but in Wells, begins to freeze at the Top; and ſeveral Arguments in proof of the contrary may be found in our Section of the <hi>Primum frigidum.</hi> And as for thoſe Pieces of Ice, which they obſerve to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merge, that Phaenomenon may eaſily be ſolved, without ſuppoſing the Water to begin to freez at the Bottom: For ſince the Water, which runs along the ſides of the Banks being froze, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Stones may ſtick to it; they by their Weight may cauſe it to ſubſide, when it is partly looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Heat of the Sun, and the Water, by that Rarifaction becomes lighter: Yet, when the Water above is cooled, and the Water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low being warmer, hath melted the Ice in ſome meaſure, and looſned ſome of thoſe Stones which were before froze to it; the Ice becoming ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fically lighter than the Water, muſt conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly emerge. On which occaſion, I ſhall here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that Capt. <hi>James Hall</hi> takes notice, That they found a Stone of three hundred weight upon a Piece of Ice. In confirmation of our Solution of this Phaenomenon, I might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Experiments laid down in the Section of the Duration of Ice. And it were to be wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that for a further Deciſion of this matter, that either <hi>Divers</hi> were ſent down, or Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59609:664"/>which would bring up Ice if any were there.</p>
                           <p>We took a ſeal'd Weather-Glaſs, and having inverted the Stem of it when furniſhed with Spirit of Wine, ſo that, that being placed in a Hole purpoſely made in a Box, the Ball of the Weather-Glaſs reſted on the Box; about that we placed a Mixture of Snow and Salt, and found, that preſently the Spirit of Wine was retracted. So that Liquors may be condenſed, without the aſſiſtance of their Gravity, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and cauſe the Parts of the Body to ſink to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: But whether in this caſe, the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was aſſiſted by the Tenacity of the Liquor or the Springineſs of ſome Elaſtick Particles, will be inquired into in a more proper Place.</p>
                           <p>Frogs and Toads being taken up from under Ice, were brisk and lively; and it is obſerv'd, that in froſty Weather they generally lye in the Bottom of Pits, for their Security.</p>

                           <p>Cold Water being expoſed to freeze in one Porringer, boiled Water cooled in another, and Hot Water in a Third, at 8 a Clock; the Cold Water began to freeze at ¼ after ten; the Boild Water cooled, at ¾ paſt ten; and the Hot Water at ¼ an hour paſt Eleven.

                           <p>The like Experiment being tryed with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contained in Glaſs-Cylinders of an equal Bore ſealed at one end, we found that there was very little difference in the time of their Congelation, when immerſed in a Mixture of Snow Salt and Water; but once, when the end of one of the Cylinders was drawn ſmaller than Ordinary, the ſmallneſs of the Pipe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the Hot Water to begin to freeze ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Cold Water.</p>

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59609:666"/>my Domeſtick who attended them, took notice al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that they both began to freeze at one time.

                           <p>For a further Confirmation of the VI Title. I ſhall add that <hi>Purchas</hi> relates <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 19. That the <hi>Samojeds,</hi> when they Bury their Dead, only cover them with a Pile of ſtones, and tho' the Dead Bodies may be ſeen through them; yet the Coldneſs of the Air preſerves them from ſtinking. And the ſame Author tells us, That in a certain Iſland they preſerve their Fiſh and Fleſh, by hardening it in the Air, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than if it were corned with Salt.</p>
                           <p>In Confirmation of what hath been delivered under the VII Title, I expoſed ſeveral Vials filled with Water and unſtopped, to be froze, and found that the Bottles were broke in pieces, by the Expanſion of the frozen Water; ſo that the Phaenomenon could not be attributed to Nature's abhorrency of a <hi>Vacuum:</hi> For if either the Expanded Water could have made it's way by ſtretching the Glaſs, or leaving the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Ice congealed at firſt in the Neck, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other way eaſier than to break the Veſſel; the Veſſel would probably be left intire, I ſay probably, becauſe ſometimes in ſuch Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59609:666"/>ſomething may intervene which requires further Tryals and Obſervations to diſcover: Since I have in other Experiments made it appear, That the Water beginning to freeze at the Bottom roſe a conſiderable height in the Stem without breaking the Bottle, and I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times had a good deal of a Liquor froze in a ſtopped Vial without breaking it, as if the ſucceſs were varyed by ſome uncommon Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties in the Glaſs, or ſome peculiar ſoftneſs of the Ice.</p>
                           <p>In Confirmation of what is delivered in the VII Title, of the Expanſion of freezing Water, I ſhall add, That the Capacity of a large Bottle being filled with Water, except the Neck, and that filled with Oyl, the expanding Water not only elevated the Cork; but raiſed it ſeveral Inches; it being ſupported by a Cylinder, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſiſting of Oily, and partly of Watry Particles of Ice.</p>
                           <p>It is a General Tradition amongſt Fiſher-men, That when Ponds or Rivers are froze up, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſeveral holes are broke up for the Air to communicate with the Water, the Fiſhes will be ſuffocated; and <hi>Olaus Magnus,</hi> tells us, That Fiſhes are uſually found ſuffocated, when a thaw comes, where Veins of living Water do not enter.</p>
                           <p>But I am not ſatisfyed, whether, if the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition be true, they may not be killed either by ſome Subterraneal Steams or their own Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious <hi>Effluvia</hi> prevented, by the Ice, from making their way out of the Water; and it may be queſtioned further, whether this Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59609:667"/>may not be cauſed, by exceſſive Cold as well as for want of Air.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore to ſatisfie my ſelf, whether the Vulgar Opinion be true or not, I encloſed ſome Gudgeons in a large Glaſs with a long Neck, and having froze the Water in the Neck by applying a Mixture of Snow and Salt, I found, That the Fiſhes lived a conſiderable time. And the like I obſerved, when the ſame Fiſhes were contained in an Earthen Veſſel with a little Water frozen over: Where the External Air was wholly ſeparated, and prevented from communicating with the Water under the Ice; yet one thing obſervable was, That there was a large Bubble of Air, under the Ice, which I ſuppoſe came from the Fiſh: For I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, not only theſe ſort of Fiſh but Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prels take in Air, and then being immerſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Water emit Bubbles, both at their Mouths and Gills. Gudgeons frozen up in Ice in a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin recovered when it was thawed; but ſome that continued 3 Days in Ice revived not. Frogs froze in Water till they were all encloſed with Ice, and till one of them was ſtiff with it, recovered when it was thawed, and Swam about; tho' before ſome of them lay with their Bellys upwards and void of Motion.</p>
                           <p>As for the weight of Bodies frozen, Capt. <hi>James</hi> tells us, That Wood, that had lain all Winter under Ice would ſink when caſt into the Water. And he likewiſe tells us, That the Ice of Wine is ſo durable, that a Butt of Wine which was froze in the Winter; conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued unthawed in <hi>May.</hi>

                           <p>It is obſerved by <hi>Purchas</hi> and ſeveral others, That the Snow lying upon the Ground in <hi>Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> as well as in <hi>England</hi> makes it fruitful.</p>

As for the Reaſon why fleſh is uſually much impaired by being froze, I ſuppoſe it to proceed hence, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Alimental Juice being expended by freezing hath not it's own texture altered only, but even the ſolid Veſſels which contain it, are thereby bruiſed and cruſhed; for from ſeveral Experiments it is evident, That Eggs will be burſt by the freezing of the Alimental Juice, and that the Textures of Stones and Vegetables will be deſtroyed by the Powerful Congelation of their reſpective Juices, which will be leſs
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59609:668"/>wondered at, if we conſider that Aqueous Parts by their Expanſion were able to burſt the Barrel of a Gun: Had I had leaſure and conveniency I would have tryed what Effects Cold hath upon Animals froze to Death; but having expoſed a Rabbet to the Cold all Night, I found that only one Leg was ſwelled and a little ſtiff. But a ſtrangled Rabbet being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be froze, Ice was produced in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Parts.</p>
                           <p>It is affirmed by ſeveral Modern Writers, That if Water be impregnated with the Salts of Vegetables; upon Congelation, they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the ſhape of the Plant they belong to: But notwithſtanding I have ſeveral times tryed the Experiment, I found it either <hi>falſe</hi> or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>contingent;</hi> ſince it did not once anſwer Expectation. But having expoſed a <hi>Lixivium</hi> of Pot-aſhes to freeze; I found, That the Chryſtals upon the Surface of the Water were Priſmatical, and that under thoſe lay a great many thin Parallel Plates of Ice; but not ranged in ſuch an order as to repreſent the ſhape of Trees: And tho' <hi>Bartholinus</hi> tells us, That if a Decoction of Cabbage be froze it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent a Cabbage; yet I could never find, That the Experiment ſucceded, except that once there appeared the faint reſemblance of a ſingle Leaf. But I have found, That fair Water froze would repreſent the ſhapes of Vegetables oftner than their Decoctions.

And on this occaſion, to what hath been ſaid I ſhall add, That by Diſtilling and rectifying Oyl of Turpentine from Sea-Salt in a Glaſs-head, as the degrees of Heat were varyed, ſo would the Figures of Trees be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented different on the inſide the Glaſs. And I have ſeveral times produced the ſhapes of Trees from Bodies belonging to the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Kingdom. And I have found, That tho' Figures curious enough would be repreſented by Spirits, Solutions, Decoctions, Vinegar, Milk and even common Water; yet it was in vain to hope for the ſame ſucceſs, and that the like Figures ſhould always be afforded by the ſame Liquor; ſince very ſmall Circumſtances would vary them conſiderably: And in trying of ſuch Experiments as theſe it may not be amiſs to advertiſe, That it will be convenient, that the Liquor ſhould be as ſhallow as it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly may, That it may be more ſpeedily froze.</p>

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59609:670"/>been delivered in the XVIII Title of the infri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidating Power of Wind, I ſhall add, That ſometimes it hath been ſo much more Cold than at others, That being blown through the frigorifick Mixture, it would cauſe not only the Spirit of Wine to ſubſide; but being blown upon the Ball of another Weather-Glaſs; not only the Liquor; but even Mercury it ſelf would be forced to aſcend, tho' the Vicinity of the frigorifick Mixture could not cauſe that Effect. And I have often tryed, That when the Temperature of the Air was ſuch, that tho' when firſt blown upon the Ball of a nice Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſcope; it would not cauſe the Liquor to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend; yet at another ſeaſon the Tinged Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor aſcended, as if the Air by being more than ordinarily compreſſed in the Room, had ſome ſenſible Effect in compreſſing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting the Air included in the Thermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope.</p>
                           <p>To try whether Liquors, by loſing their fluidity and becoming conſiſtent would acquire a greater degree of Coldneſs, I cauſed the Ball of a Weather-Glaſs to be immerſed in Sallet-Oyl, and a Solution of <hi>Minium</hi> in Vinegar, or of Quick-lime in Water, either of which will coagulate the Oyl; but I did not find, That the Mixture tho' conſiſtent was Colder than the fluid Ingredients.</p>
                           <p>To try whether Water was capable of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, we took a Glaſs-Ball with a long Stem, and filled it with Water within two Inches of the Top; then we Hermetically ſealed it up, and freezing it from the Bottom upwards in a fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorifick
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:59609:671"/>Mixtre, when the included Air was compreſſed as much as we thought the Glaſs would bear, we nipt off the Apex; and found, That thereupon the Air flew out and the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter roſe ¼ of an Inch above it's former Surface: So that it ſeemed to be compreſſed ⅜ of the length of the Aqueous Cylinder; but whether this Phaenomenon might be occaſion'd, by the Spring of ſome latent Air in the Pores of the Water, or whether it might be occaſioned by ſome Springineſs in the Ice, or Whether the Glaſs being before diſtended and now reduced to it's former Dimenſions occaſioned this Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon, I will not undertake to determine without further Tryals. And,</p>
                           <p>To what hath been obſerved in this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I ſhall add, That if the Apex were broke off before the Air was much compreſſed, it would cauſe no conſiderable Noiſe: And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when the Experiment was a ſecond time repeated with one of the ſame Glaſſes, and the ſame Liquor; it would riſe ⅛ and ¼ in the Stem, higher than before, upon breaking of the Apex.</p>

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Arguments alleaged in Favour of an <hi>Antiperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſis.</hi>
                        </note>THO' the Doctrine of <hi>Antiperiſtaſis</hi> be aſſerted by <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> and ſome of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers urge Reaſon and Experience in favour of it, yet from what follows it will appear, That what is offered is not ſufficient to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Doctrine.</p>
                     <p>For firſt it is Reaſoned in favour of it, That nothing can be more requiſite for the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of things, and more agreeable to the wiſdom and goodneſs of Nature, than to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Cold and Heat with a ſelf invigorating Power, which each of them may exert when encompaſs'd with the other; and that nothing is more Natural, than for one Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, when ſurrounded with a Predominant one, to retire into the innermoſt receſſes of that Body; where the force of it being increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, an occaſional Exertion of that Power is called <hi>Antiperiſtaſis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But from Reaſon to proceed to Experience, it is offered by the maintainers of an <hi>Antiperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſis,</hi> That in the Summer, when the loweſt and uppermoſt Regions of the Air are inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portably Hot, the Cold flyes to the middle Region of it, and there defends it ſelf againſt the other two about it: And as the Cold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in the middle Region, by virtue of an <hi>Antiperiſtaſis,</hi> ſo Lightning is but an Exploſion of Exhalations pinned up in the Cold.</p>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:59609:672"/>

                     <p>And to this it is further offered, That the Effects of <hi>Antiperiſtaſis</hi> are not only evident in the Air, but the Earth it ſelf; for in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, when the Air above the Earth is Hot, that in Cellars to which the Cold retreats is of a contrary Quality; and on the contrary in the Winter, when the Air without is exceſſive Cold, that in Vaults and Cellars is warm; and even the Water drawn from Wells is warm, when at the ſame time Rivers themſelves are covered over with Ice. And,</p>
                     <p>To theſe things it is further offered in Favour of an <hi>Antiperiſtaſis,</hi> That in deep Pits as well as Mines, it is obſerved, that the Air is troubleſome hot in the Winter: And that it is further obſerved, That the Water in <hi>Charlton</hi>-Iſland hath been obſerved to be much Colder in <hi>June</hi> when Ice ſwam in it, than in <hi>December;</hi> and that a Well which furniſhed them with Water in <hi>December,</hi> afforded none in <hi>July;</hi> and further, That in <hi>Muſco</hi> the Cellars are able to defend them in Winter from the Exceſſive Cold; and that even in thoſe Gelid Climates, Water drawn out of Wells uſually ſteams or ſmoaks if agitated when newly drawn.</p>
                     <p>Thus much being offered in favour of the Doctrine of <hi>Antiperiſtaſis,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Thoſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</note> it is anſwered on the contrary; firſt, as to the rational defences of it, That there it no neceſſity that theſe two Qualities ſhould thus invigorate themſelves, there being no danger of them being loſt out of the World; ſince without the help of an <hi>Antiperiſtaſis,</hi> there are ſeveral ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which are plentifully ſtocked with matter to ſupply each Quality: Beſides, according to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:59609:673"/>the courſe of Nature, contrary Qualities ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſtroy than preſerve one another; and even the Peripateticks themſelves allow, That all Agents act as much as they can. And we have ſeveral Inſtances in the Northern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, That the Natural Heat of Animals is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed and not increaſed by the help of Cold; and tho' it be commonly alledged, to ſhew that Contraries endeavour to ſhun each other, That a drop of Water falling upon a Table keeps in a Globular form; yet the Reaſon of that ſeems only to be this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the ſpecifick Gravity of the drop is not ſo far preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent above it's Tenacity, as to cauſe it to ſpread; beſides, it is prevented partly by the Ambient Preſſure of the Atmoſphere: And that it's Globous Figure is not owing to its averſion to ſpread upon a dry Body, and its diſpoſition to ſhun Contraries is evident, ſince it retains the like Figure when mixed with fluid Oyl; and <hi>Mercury</hi> on the contrary, tho' it be apter to retain a Globular Figure upon a Table, yet if put upon Gold it loſes that Figure.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Whether the Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena of ſlacked Quick-lime be an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of <hi>Antiperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſis.</hi>
                        </note>But to paſs by what Reaſons may be offered againſt the Doctrine of <hi>Antiperiſtaſis:</hi> To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to examine what Experiments and Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations have been alledged in favour of it; I ſhall firſt obſerve, That tho' the ſlacking of Quick-lime with Cold Water be generally looked upon to be an Effect of <hi>Antiperiſtaſis;</hi> yet it appears otherwiſe, ſince it will cauſe a much more violent Ebullition, if boiling Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be made uſe of inſtead of Cold; the Parts of the hot Liquor being much more apt to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59609:674"/>and diſſolve it, and to ſet the Igneous Parts at Liberty; for which Reaſon, Spirit of Salt cauſes ſtill a ſtronger ferment than hot Water. But to ſhew further, That Water ſlacks not Lime, becauſe its Coldneſs keeps in, and thereby invigorates the Power of the Igneous fiery Parts of the Lime, I put a piece into Oyl of Turpentine, which did not in the leaſt diſſolve it, nor did Spirit of Wine, tho' upon the removal of it into Water, it was preſently diſſolved.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Another Argument Examin'd.</note>Another Argument alledged for an <hi>Antiperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſis,</hi> is the freezing of a Pot to the Top of a ſtool at the fire ſide, by a mixture of Snow and Salt; but this Experiment having likewiſe ſucceded, where there was no fire near, it could not be ſaid that the Effect depended upon the force of the fire invigorating the Cold.</p>
                     <p>Another Experiment employed by the Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of an <hi>Antiperiſtaſis</hi> is, That if a Pot of Snow be ſet over the fire, and a Vial full of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be placed in the middle of it, it will up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the melting of the Snow be turned into Ice; but this Experiment having been often tryed, ſucceded not; yet tho' it ſhould, any other Agent which would melt the Ice would as ſoon produce the Effect.</p>

                        </note>But as a further Argument of an <hi>Antiperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſis,</hi> it is urged, that in the Summer the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and third Regions of the Air are Hot, and the middlemoſt Cold, which to me ſeems rather aſſerted; than proved, for not to inſiſt on this, <hi>viz.</hi> That according to the Peripateticks, the Natural State of the Air being Hot, I ſee not how it ſhould be Cold in Summer, nor
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59609:674"/>can I ſee why the Third Region ſhould be ſo Hot, ſince it lyes ſo far from the Superficies of the Earth, that the reflected Rays of the Sun cannot reach it; and tho' it be urged that it is Hot, becauſe Meteors have been kindled there; yet the ſame Argument would prove the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Region Hot, ſince Meteors and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning have been obſerved there; and even in the lower Region; it being common in Storms fort hoſe fires called <hi>Helena,</hi> or <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> to hover about the Maſts of Ships.</p>

But tho' Concoction depended chiefly upon Heat; yet the greater Heat of the Stomach in Winter could not be attributed to <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periſtaſis;</hi> but a Retention of Hot Humors generated in the Heart, which gradually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, produce in all Parts of the Body a more than ordinary Heat, and by that means prepare a greater Quantity of the <hi>Stomachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Menſtruum.</hi> Bendes Contraries themſelves, in reſpect of other Qualities, agree in this, That they increaſe Appetite, as Spices, Wine, and Vinegar; and alſo Wormwood and Juice of Limons.

                     <p>Hail is thought by the <hi>Ariſtotelians</hi> to be generated in the lower Region of the Air,<note place="margin">The Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Hail exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</note> the drops of Rain that fall out of the middle Region being there congealed, by an <hi>Antipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtaſis,</hi> and that it is only generated in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. But on the contrary, I have obſerved my ſelf the greateſt ſhower of Hail that ever I ſaw to fall in <hi>January,</hi> when the violence of the Froſt had rendred the lower Region of the Air Cold; at which time a Servant to one of my Domeſticks told her Maſter, That ſhe was led out of her way by an <hi>Ignis Fatuus,</hi> which, till ſhe could follow it no further, ſhe took to be a Candle, carryed by another Perſon before her; where how the Nocturnal Air could kindle a fiery Meteor by it's Coldneſs, and congeal Snow by it's Heat, I profeſs I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand: Beſides were <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s account true, I ſee not why they ſhould never ſee it Hail at <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Peluſium,</hi> places in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where the lower Region of the Air is hot enough, and where it rains frequently; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides we have ſeen Grains of Hail larger by much than dreps of Rain, and at <hi>Lyons</hi> in <hi>France</hi> the <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> took Notice of a ſhower of Hail whoſe Grains were as large as a Tennis-Ball; and <hi>Bartholinus</hi> tells us, That he himſelf hath obſerved ſome ſo large, That they weighed a Pound; and to theſe I ſhall add, that tho' <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> aſſerts Hail to be generated in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:59609:675"/>Grains of Ice, which contain'd Snow in the middle of them.</p>
                     <p>The next Argument alledged in favour of <hi>Antiperiſtaſis,</hi> and to be examined, is the Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Cellars in Summer, and their Heat in Winter.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, I deny that the Air in Cellars is cooler in Summer than Winter; ſince the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why we feel it ſo, is only the Prediſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Senſories, which are comparatively warmer, by being encloſed in ſo warm an Air as that they are encompaſſed with in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: But ſuppoſing, that not only our ſenſes, but Weather-Glaſſes ſhould inform us, That the Air in Cellars were Colder in the Summer than Winter; yet it might be accounted for without an <hi>Antiperiſtaſis:</hi> for ſince there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral hot <hi>Effluvia</hi> ſent up from ſubterraneal Parts, theſe reſtrain'd and kept from flying away in the Winter, may alter the temper of the Soil, and Subterraneal Waters; but when by the Heat of Summer the Pores of the Earth are opened, and way is made for the Avolition of them; upon that account the Superficial Parts of the Earth may be a little cooler.</p>
                     <p>And for a like reaſon; we may think Cellars hotter in the Winter than the Summer, if we judge of them by the Teſtimony of our Senſes; ſince we are not there affected with thoſe Winds and External Agents of Cold, as in the open Air; and therefore to one that comes out of the open Air into them, they may ſeem Warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
                     <p>But that Cellars are Colder in the Winter than the Summer, when we eſtimate the degrees
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59609:676"/>of them by Bodies that are not alike ſubject to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſitions as our Bodies are; will appear from what follows. And firſt, two ſealed Weather-Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes being hung out in a froſty Evening, till they were both of an Equal temper; the one of them remov'd into a Cellar, in two or three Hours aſcended five or fix Diviſions; whilſt that which remain'd in the Air rather deſcended than roſe; but in the Morning that in the Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar deſcended a little, ſo that the outward Air inſtead of Increaſing rather Diminiſhed the Heat of the Cellar: And Oyl which in thaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Weather was uſually Liquid, being placed in a Cellar in a froſty Night, was congealed; ſo that it would ſubſide in other Oyl: And I have further obſerv'd, That Oyl that was froze in the Cellar upon a thaw roſe inſtead of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding according to the Doctrine of <hi>Antiperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſis.</hi> And in <hi>Poland</hi> it is obſerv'd, That in the Winter ſmall Beer freezes in the Cellars; and the like I have obſerv'd in <hi>England</hi> in a Cellar, which in the Summer kept Beer cool enough. And I am told, That in <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> the Cellars are ſo far from being ſo Cold in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer as in Winter, that they are forced to keep their Beer in the Summer in Water froze with Snow, and to dig their Barrels out as they have occaſion.</p>
                     <p>But tho' we ſhould allow, That ſome Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars and Vaults are warmer in Winter than Summer, yet it does not therefore follow, that it muſt be the Effects of an <hi>Antiperiſtaſis;</hi> ſince it may be done by the Influence of Subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal fires; for which Reaſon deep Cellars are generally warmeſt: And it hath been obſerv'd,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59609:676"/>That the deepeſt Mines in <hi>Hungary</hi> are always the hotteſt; and tho' the upper Region in ſome meaſure ſeems Cold, yet that may eaſily be cauſed by the Prediſpoſition of our Senſories, when out of the warm Air we find it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively Colder in the top of the Groove, and in our aſcent Colder in reſpect of thoſe Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are nearer the Influence of Subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal fires. And that the lower Regions are hotter than the uppermoſt, is not only evident from what hath been elſewhere delivered; but from what Arch-Biſhop <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſal</hi> hath obſerv'd in the deep Mountains in <hi>Poland,</hi> from whence they dig Rock-Salt.</p>
                     <p>And tho' the Heat of Springs in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be alledged by ſome as a cauſe of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiperiſtaſis;</hi> yet it is eaſily otherwiſe explain'd, ſince the Subterraneal <hi>Effluvia</hi> of the Earth, as well as the Comparative Coldneſs of the Air is ſufficient to ſolve that Phaenomenon: And that the <hi>Antiperiſtaſis</hi> is not ſo powerful in the Winter, as to have any effect on the Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneal Parts is evident; ſince Capt. <hi>James</hi> tells us, That he had a Well which remain'd unfroze all Winter; ſo that by breaking the Ice on the top they could get freſh Water: And it is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted by a <hi>Latin</hi> Author, That in or near the Iſland <hi>Hueena,</hi> wherein the famous <hi>Tycho</hi> built his <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rani-Burgum,</hi> there is one Spring which is not froze in Winter, and <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> tells us, That near <hi>Nidroſia,</hi> one of the chief Cities of <hi>Norway,</hi> there is a Lake that in that Northern Region never freezes. And <hi>Joſephus</hi> informs us of a hot Spring in <hi>Peru,</hi> from whence the Waters iſſue out boiling hot; yet a Spring
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59609:677" rendition="simple:additions"/>which is juſt by it is Cold as Ice; ſo that the Nature of the Soil through which Bodies flow, may have a conſiderable ſtroak in altering the Temper of the Water. And to favour what I have ſaid of the Reaſon why Springs ſteam in the Summer, I ſhall add, That it is obſerv'd, that our Breath as well as the ſteams of Iſſues are viſible in the Winter; tho' not diſcerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the Summer; and the very ſteams of a labouring Man have been froze on the outſide of his waſtcoat whilſt he was working. And it's commonly obſerv'd, That the ſteams of a River are very apparent in the Evenings, tho' not diſcernable at Mid-day in Summer.</p>
                     <p>And that the Earth is not only heated by thoſe Subterraneal ſteams<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that thoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors which we frequently ſee, proceed from Subterraneal <hi>Effluvia,</hi> will be rendred proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by obſerving, That Miners uſually foretel Storms and alterations in the Air, by the damps which riſe in their Mines: And in <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall</hi> it is obſerv'd by the Fiſher-men, that thoſe Sulphureous Exhalations which appear like fire up and down, generally precede conſiderable Storms. And the like hath been obſerv'd on the Coaſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> when a black Cloud like a Barrel riſing out of the Water, a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Storm preſently ſucceeded.</p>
                     <p>And an Anonymous Writer tells us, That in <hi>Comitatus Zotienſis</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> a Clift of Ground emits ſuch ſteams, that Birds and Cats or Dogs being held over it are killed by the ſteams of it: And the ſame Author tells us, That near the City <hi>Buda,</hi> there are ſuch hot Springs, that the River <hi>Danubius</hi> is not able
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59609:677"/>to keep them cool; and he tells us likewiſe, that in the River <hi>Iſtroganum,</hi> they may diſcover hot Springs; by removing the ſand with their feet. And I am inform'd by credible witneſſes, That in the North of <hi>England</hi> there is a ditch which emits ſteams, which are inflamable; and probably there may be other places which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſuch kind of <hi>Effluvia,</hi> and afford matter for fiery Meteors and Winds.</p>
                     <p>And we are told, That not only in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> a Tract of Water a Mile long continued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>froze, when the reſt was, and emitted hot ſteams: But <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> tells us of a Lake <hi>Veter,</hi> which thaws with a conſiderable noiſe, That as well as the River <hi>Peking</hi> near <hi>China,</hi> which thaws in one Day, beginning at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom and ſo thaws upwards; and in theſe thaws it is obſerv'd, That they are foretold by a great boiling of the Water firſt under the Ice. And that ſuch <hi>Effluvia</hi> being detained from flying away, and kept up in the Earth may contribute to the Heating of Cellars ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears further; ſince in <hi>Muſcow,</hi> when a Cellar hath been long kept ſhut; when firſt the door is opened, the ſteams will affect the Men ſo Powerfully, as almoſt to ſuffocate them.</p>
                     <p>So that from hence it appears, That the Retention of hot <hi>Effluvia</hi> depend on a Conſtipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Pores of the Earth; and not on the Diſpoſition of hot Vapors to fly away from their contrary; ſince we ſee that they have no ſuch Diſpoſition, the Vapors of a Well rather di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſing themſelves in the Air than flying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from it.</p>
                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:59609:678"/>
                     <p>But to diſprove the Doctrine of <hi>Antiperiſtaſis,</hi> further, I ſhall add, That a rod of Iron, which had a piece of Iron fixed to one end of it, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that end made red hot, and quenched in Cold Water, the Heat did not recede into the other end, to avoid the Coldneſs of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>But a more convincing Experiment is, That a Weather-Glaſs being ſuſpended in a wide-mouth'd Glaſs in Water, when that Glaſs was placed in hot Water, the Coldneſs of that in the wide-mouth'd Glaſs, was ſo far from being drove upon the Weather-Glaſs, that the Spirit of Wine did not in the leaſt ſubſide; but when the Heat of the External Water was diffuſed through the other, it manifeſtly roſe. And this Experiment being try'd with warm Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the wide-mouth'd Glaſs, and Cold Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about that, the Heat was not more intenſe about the Weather-Glaſs; but when the Cold had diffuſed it ſelf through the warm Water, the Spirit of Wine ſubſided.</p>

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59609:678"/>Winter, yet I am far from believing this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation univerſal; ſince what hath been ſaid evinces the contrary; for, tho' the ſuperficial Parts of the Earth are ſubject to vary in their Temperature, as the Weather influences them; yet Subterraneal Cavities than are very deep are neither hotter or colder in the Winter or Summer; and tho' <hi>Zucchius</hi> hath undertaken to meaſure it by the aſſiſtance of Weather-Glaſſes; yet ſince ordinary Weather-Glaſſes are ſubject to be influenced by the Gravity of the Air, as well as the Heat and Cold of it; and ſince ſome places are fuller of Subterraneal Vapors than others, and conſequently the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den aſcent of Exhalations may preſently increaſe the weight of it, I think the following Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment made by the learned <hi>Maignan</hi> ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ballance what <hi>Zucchius</hi> hath delivered, and therefore I ſhall deliver it in the Authors words. <hi>Expertus ego ſum</hi> (ſays he) <hi>Thermometro fideliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimo &amp; a praecedente hyeme in ſequentem aeſtatem prorſus invariato, inſtructo etiam tali aqua, nem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe in hoc ipſum, ex praeſcripto Trebellii ita com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parata ut non exhaletur, ne<expan>

                        <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> An Examination of Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> Doctrine of Cold.</head>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> Doctrine of Cold.</note>Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> in his Doctrine of Cold tells us, That the Air being put into an Expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive motion by the Beams of the Sun, it is beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en down upon the Surface of the Earth; where finding a reſiſtance below, it ſpreads it ſelf e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way towards the Poles, and as the Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel Circles grow cloſer towards the Poles, ſo the Air being ſtraitned and more condenſed cauſes a greater degree of Cold.</p>
                     <p>To which he adds, That as the Air moves betwixt theſe Parallers, it rakes upon the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of Water, more or leſs as the Air is more or leſs ſtraitned; by which means the Water not only tending towards its Centre by its own Gravity, but being alſo condenſed by the rakeing Preſſure of the Air, the Surface of it is firſt congealed, and then it gradually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends; and for a like Reaſon when Water is immerſed in Snow and Salt, the Mixture melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe very Parts which lodged in the Pores of it, they rakeing againſt the ſides of the Glaſs, give it ſuch a motion, as when communicated to the Water contain'd in it cauſes it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geal. And for a Reaſon not unlike the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the Particles of Air contain'd in Clouds being in their deſcent ſqueezed out, rake the drops of Water in their paſſage, and ſo harden them.</p>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:59609:679"/>
                     <p>And the Reaſon why ſerene weather is Colder than rainy weather, he ſays is; becauſe the force of the Wind is broken and diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the falling drops; which Reaſon he likewiſe alledges, why Water in Wells is not froze, the Wind not being able to beat ſtrongly enough upon the Surface of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>And as for the Reaſon why Ice is lighter than Water, he attributes it to Airy Particles, forced into it whilſt it is congealing.</p>
                     <p>But it may eaſily be urged againſt this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,<note place="margin">Examined.</note> that all congealed Liquors, inſtead of having their Parts preſſed inwards, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed, manifeſtly expand upon Congelation. And as for Animal Bodies, ſuch an inward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of the Humors, as his Doctrine ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, is not requiſite to produce a ſenſation of Cold; ſince a decreaſe of the motion of the fluids about our Senſories, or an Impulſe made upon the ſenſitive Parts, by ſome alteration in the motion of the Blood and Spirits, or a turbulent motion of ſome excrementitious Particles hindred from flying away is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; ſo ſome Hyſterick Women perceive a Coldneſs on the top of their Heads and the <hi>Vertebra,</hi> when they are otherwiſe hot; and <hi>Avicen</hi> tells us, That the biting of ſome Vipers in hot Countries cauſes a ſenſation of Cold: And I know a Noble Man who feels an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Coldneſs upon him, when he is ſeiz'd with a fit of the Stone. And an inward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Parts of a Body is ſo far from being ſufficient to produce Cold, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in ſome Bodies produces Heat.</p>
                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:59609:680"/>
                     <p>But to examine what he aſſigns as the Grand Cauſe of Cold, <hi>viz. Wind,</hi> which according to him <hi>is Air moved in a conſiderable quantity, and that either forwards only, or in an undulating motion.</hi> But againſt this Doctrine I have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things to offer. And
<list>
                           <item>firſt, that ſeveral froſts are begun and continued when the Wind is ſerene and calm; and that a gentle North-eaſt-wind is much Colder than a boiſterous Southerly Wind.</item>
                           <item>Secondly, That the Wind which iſſues out of an <hi>Aeolopile</hi> is not Cold but Hot, tho' it moves more violently than the Wind which is blown from the Mouth.</item>
                        </list> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, We have made it appear, That Water will freeze, tho' ſealed up in a Glaſs, and tho' that Glaſs be incloſed in another, ſo that the Wind cannot beat upon it; and even an Egg frozen will be cruſted over with Ice, when ſuſpended in Water, ſo that the External Air cannot Effect it.</p>
                     <p>And tho' he tells us, That all Winds pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Cold: <hi>Proſper Alpinus</hi> in his <hi>Medicina Aegyptiorum</hi> acquaints us, that he hath found the Winds in thoſe Torrid Regions inſufferably hot. And <hi>Marcus Paulus Venetus</hi> tells us, That the Winds near <hi>Ormus</hi> have been ſo hot as to deſtroy an Army of Men at once: And tho' ſome Winds put into motion feel Cold, yet that depends on the Prediſpoſition of our Senſories, and the deeper penetration of that fluid into the Pores of the Body, in reſpect of which it hath a comparative Coldneſs; and that it is but a comparative Coldneſs is evident, ſince the ſame Wind blowing upon a Weather-Glaſs affects it not at all; except ſometimes by
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:59609:680"/>accident, when, by that means, ſome calorifick Atoms ſwimming in the Air, are driven away by it. And tho' Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> tells us, that all Winds cool <hi>by diminiſhing former Heat,</hi> yet we ſee, that Water actually Cold, becomes ſtill Colder by freezing, where the Heat cannot be ſaid to be diminiſhed in a Body actually Cold before.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed, tho' Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> ſays, that Wind is generated upon the Surface of the Earth by the action of the Sun; yet he tells us not how that Wind muſt produce Cold; nor does the motion of it towards the Poles help the matter, ſince we have ſhewn, that motion in it ſelf is not ſufficient to produce Cold; and ſhould he ſay, that the Coldneſs is derived from the Mixture of freezing Vapours in it's paſſage, then thoſe ſteams would rather be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the cauſe of Cold, than the Wind; and then I ſhould ask him, Whence the Coldneſs of thoſe Cold Vapours proceeded?</p>
                     <p>Beſides, ſince in his account of the freezing of Water, he ſays the Parts of the freezing Water will be raiſed in Congelation, I ſee not how it will happen; ſince Oyl and ſeveral other Liquors are contracted by it, and I have not yet ſeen any one Inſtance in which Water was ever congeal'd by a Compreſſion: Since when we incloſed Water in a Pewter-Bottle and beat the ſides of it together, till the Water made its way out; we perceiv'd not, that that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful compreſſion had in the leaſt inclined the Water to Congelation. And tho' we ſhould allow, that the Superficial Parts of the Water might be froze as Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> tells us, yet I ſee not how the Air can beat upon Water, ſevered from, it by Ice nine or ten Foot thick.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59609:681"/>Beſides, I think it altogether inconceivable, how Wind by taking upon the outſide of a Glaſs, ſhould cauſe the Water within to freeze, ſince the freezing of Water is an action much different from the putting of the Glaſs into a trembling motion; beſides we ſee, that Water will not be froze by the blowing of a ſtrong Wind againſt the outſide of a Glaſs, tho' it will when encloſed in Liquors where no Wind can come at it, and thoſe two which are not ſubject to freeze themſelves.</p>
                     <p>And whereas Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> gives it as a Reaſon why ſome Wells freeze not, becauſe the Wind hath not liberty to blow ſtrong enough upon the Water, I ſhall add, that thoſe Wells that are ſubject to be froze when Northerly or Eaſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Winds blow, will freeze, tho' covered o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and ſufficiently guarded from the Winds; and in Cold Winters, whether the Wind blows or not. And,</p>
                     <p>Whereas Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> tells us, that the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Ice above Water, proceeds from the bubbles received into it whilſt it is freezing; the Contrary is evident, ſince Water froze in a ſeal'd Glaſs, will be plentifully ſtocked with bubbles as well as that which is frozen in the free Air.</p>

                        <p>To conclude this Hiſtory of Cold, I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſome other Experiments deſigned for this Treatiſe, ſubjoyn an Experiment elſewhere mention'd in the Hiſtory of whiteneſs and black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:59609:681"/>
                           <hi>viz.</hi> Take a piece of Cork and having burnt it, till it be reduced to a black Coal, and then having ſlacked it in fair Water, it will, by being mixed with Gum-water, form a black Ink, which you may write what you pleaſe with; which writing if it be interlined with a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourleſs Solution of <hi>Minium</hi> in Spirit of Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, upon wetting the Paper with a ſpunge dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in a fluid Liquor, prepared by mixing three Parts of Quick-lime and one of yellow orpiment, and digeſting them two or three hours in ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Parts of Water, the inviſible Solution of <hi>Minium</hi> will exhibit black Letters, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther black ones will diſappear; but whilſt this fetid Liquor is preparing, it muſt be well ſhaken ſeveral times, that the Quick-lime and the powdered orpiment may the better impregnate it, and then the decanted and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred Liquor muſt be kept for uſe.</p>
                        <p>But beſides this, there are ſeveral other ways of making Ink, which I could be glad to learn: And I my ſelf have tryed that Words might be writ with a Solution of <hi>Minium,</hi> which I could render legible by the help of the fire.</p>

                     <p>Cold Water expoſed to the Air in open Pans was froze in an hour, boiling Water in two; boiling and Cold Water mix'd in ½; the Cold Water beginning to freeze at the top and and ſides, but the other at the bottom; and when the Water was Cold at the top. The ſame ſucceeded, with Water thrown upon a Table, the Cold Water being firſt froze. A four ounce Vial with a Stem a Foot long and half filled, being exhauſted of Air in <hi>Vacuo Boyliano,</hi> was almoſt froze as ſoon as Water expoſed in an open Pan, and appear'd white ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to conſiſt purely of bubbles. Water in which <hi>Arsnick</hi> was eight Months infuſed, congealed into a white Ice ſooner than Water, and ſo did So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of all ſorts of Vitriols; and ſooner than Solutions of other Salts; except Allum, which froze into an Ice whiter than Milk, and ſtuck ſo faſt to the Pan that I could ſcarce ſeparate it.</p>

Two drams of common Salt diſſolved in four ounces of Water was in hard froſt congealed into a white Ice in about thirty hours. Stinking Sea-Water full of Salt being expoſed in a Beer-Glaſs, was covered with a film of Ice as thick as ½ a Crown in twenty ſix hours; when froze it taſted Salt and ſmelled ſtinking; but when thawed it had loſt the fetor: In four days more the whole was froze, but that in the bottom taſted ſharper than the reſt. The ſame Water in broad Pans was quite froze through in thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſix hours, and ſooner in a Mixture of Snow and Salt; neither a ſtrong Solution of Salt-Petre, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Bay-Salt, nor <hi>Sal-Armoniack</hi> were froze in ſix days. But a Solution of Salt of Tartar froze in a little more time than Water; and being expoſed in a Tube it began to freeze at the bottom, top and ſides all once; whereas other Liquors freeze uniformly either at the top or bottom firſt.</p>
                     <p>Salt-Petre in a Cold ſeaſon was in twenty eight hours froze into a white Ice, which was miſtaken for <hi>Sal-Prunel,</hi> and ſparkled in the fire as that Salt uſually does. <hi>A lixivium</hi> of it made with Copperas or Allum ſingly or mixed, ſet in Snow and Salt or Snow alone, was frozen in one Night. <hi>Sal-Gem,</hi> tho' Snow and Salt were mixed with it, and tho' it were ſet in Snow and Salt, would not be brought to freeze. But Phlegm of Vitriol froze ſooner than the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions before mention'd</p>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:59609:683"/>
                     <p>Oyl of Vitriol is coagulated ſooner than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the afore mention'd Liquors, except Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; a large Tube being filled ¼ with it, and being froze, taſted of a ſtrong Vitriolate taſte; the coagulated Part, was of a paler colour than the other, and both being poured toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a Bottle, it became too hot to hold in one's hands, this coagulated Part remain'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaw'd a week after the reſt of the Liquors; and another Tube of the ſame Oyl being whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly froze, it ſubſided ½ an Inch below its ſtation to which it roſe again upon a thaw, but the other Liquors roſe upon congelation.</p>
                     <p>A flask of ſmall Beer froze in thirty eight hours, but three Parts of Ale continued unfroze after ſix days hard Froſt; but at four a Clock in the morning, the unfroze Liquor taſted much ſtronger and brisker than before it was froze; the Ice was leſs firm and fuller of bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles than common Ice, and being thawed was very pale and of a quick Aleiſh taſte. A Beer-Glaſs of <hi>Hull</hi>-Ale being expoſed to the Cold in a Glaſs, in twenty four hours was cruſted over with Ice, as thick as half a Crown, and that being taken off, it yielded another; and ſo ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, till the whole was froze; theſe <hi>Laminae</hi> were all of the ſame colour and taſte, but the loweſt was the moſt tender: This Ale would not freeze ſo ſoon as that which I expoſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. <hi>Hull</hi>-Ale hath a brackiſh taſte.</p>
                     <p>Claret expoſed in a ſpoon, in thirty five hours was turned into a ſoft Ice, which had the Genuine colour and taſte of Wine. In thirty eight hours Canary expoſed in a ſpoon was covered with a thin film, which grew no thicker in
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59609:683"/>four days. But neither Claret or Canary would freeze in Tubes or Bottles.</p>
                     <p>Two ounces of Spirit of Wine expoſed in a ſpoon all evaporated in twelve hours; but the ſame quantity of Brandy left about a ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of Ice void both of taſte and it's Inflammable Quality; but being held betwixt my Eye and a candle it diſcover'd ſeveral bubbles.</p>
                     <p>An Ox and a Sheep's Eye were both frozen through in one Night, the three Humours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Opacous, hard and inſeparable. The Chryſtalline humour was white like Whitings boil'd, the wateriſh and glaſſy humour ſeemed to be made of flakes of Ice.</p>
                     <p>Sheeps Blood expoſed to freeze, the <hi>Serum</hi> was turned to Ice, which, being ſeparated from the Blood and thawed at the fire, congealed a ſecond time into a Membranous ſubſtance; but the Blood was not in the leaſt froze. The Heart and Blood in the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> of a Dog and Cat expoſed dead to the Air were both froze: Milk froze into white flakes, being ſoft and with few bubbles in it, and retaining the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per taſte of Milk. The yolks and Whites of Eggs were froze in one Night, they thaw beſt by lying on <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> Coals or in a deep Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: I am told that Eggs, tho' they have been froze, will produce Chickens-Eggs held near the Surface of the Water when froze will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a cruſt of Ice on the outſide, the inward Parts of it ſtill remaining froze; and if thoſe Eggs whilſt froze, be poched, they will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tough. An Egg and an Apple being ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended two Foot deep in a Ciſtern and taken up after twenty four hours, tho' both of them
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59609:684"/>were full of Ice within, yet neither of them had contracted Ice on the outſide.</p>
                     <p>Horſe-Radiſhes and Onions froze, yet Beer in which Horſe-Radiſh and Scurvey-Graſs are infuſed will not freeze ſo ſoon as ſtrong Beer without them. Oranges and Limons froze, have a hard and tough rind, and loſe their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine taſte; and when thawed they ſoon become rotten: Apples Cut in the middle, will have a thin Ice on both plains, which may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by a knife or the touch. The skins of theſe Apples ſoon turn brown, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to corrupt there. Oyl expoſed look'd like Butter melted and coagulated again; but in Caves and Cellars, it would never appear more than Candied. White Wine-Vinegar froze in a Tube without apparent bubbles.

But tho' theſe Spirits would not freeze, yet being mixed with twelve Parts of Water, all of them froze ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Spirit of Salt, Nitre and <hi>Aqua fortis:</hi> I am told that one having diſſolv'd Ice in the North Seas found it Salt.</p>
                     <p>As for the figures of Liquors froze, Allum appear'd in lumps, Salt-Petre, Tartar, Milk, Ale, Wine and <hi>Sal-Armoniack</hi> in plates. And
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59609:684"/>other Liquors which compoſed a ſoft Ice, ſeen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be compoſed of <hi>Globuli</hi> adhering to each others. Water, <hi>Kelp</hi> and Frits reſembled the fibres of an Oaken leaf, the interſtices being filled up with ſmoother Ice, and the middle Fibres, as in Plants, appeared larger than the others, and made acute Angles at the leſſer end of the leaf. But as for the figures of frozen Urine, thoſe having been accurately deſcrib'd by the curious Mr. <hi>Hook,</hi> I ſhall paſs that part of my task by.</p>
                     <p>I took the Salts of Roſemary, Rue, Scurvey-Graſs, Mint and Plantan, and putting ½ or ¾ of an ounce of each into ½ of a pint of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled Waters; the Rue and Plantan being ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, none of them froze reſembled the Plants they belong'd to; but the Aromatick Waters were much enriched in their ſcents, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the Roſemary; <hi>Kelp</hi> froze repreſents the leaves of <hi>Alga Marina.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Recipient full of Water being froze and the top of the Ice broke, there appeared a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity within, which was thick ſet with Plates of Ice from which <hi>Stiriae</hi> appeared on each ſide like the Teeth of Combs, ſome of which ſtood at ſuch a diſtance that I could put my finger betwixt them.</p>
                     <p>A flask full of Water being froze it appear'd full of bubbles like tailed hail-ſhot, the ſharp points of all of them pointing upwards. They had Cavities which would admit a Pin into them and might be diſcerned in the Ice, appearing like black ſpots: And in the middle of the Ice was contained a Cavity filled with Water in
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59609:685"/>which were ſeveral of theſe bubbles imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly formed.</p>
                     <p>All the Liquors I made Experiments with, did ſenſibly riſe above the mark, before they froze, and more after congelation. Vinegar and Urine roſe ½ an Inch, and Lees made of Salts of Roſemary, <hi>Kelp</hi> and Frits, about ½ of an Inch. Solutions of Allum and Copperas leſs, and Saline Liquors in general leſs than Water, which roſe a full Inch, and ſmall Beer in a narrow Tube four Inches. Oyl of Vitriol alone ſubſides below the mark, hot Water ſubſides till it is cool and then riſes again.</p>
                     <p>Water being froze in Beer-Glaſſes, riſes up and forms ſolid Triangles, but the riſing of it is more viſible in narrow Glaſſes: Ice in a flask roſe four Inches above the Water-mark, and hung two Inches out of it, but in a Bolt-head it roſe five Inches above the Water-mark. If Glaſſes be filled about ⅔ full they ſeldom break. Round Spherical Glaſſes uſually break uniformly. A Bolt-head being filled up to the neck with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the top which was twelve Inches above it, was ſealed up; upon which the Water being froze, was raiſed three Inches into the neck; and the Glaſs breaking in the thinneſt Part, from that point, ſeveral Lines ran as from a Pole to the Meridian, but none of them went round the Glaſs, nor were they all of the ſame length: In a flask cracked in many places the cracks were irregular: Glaſs Bottles and ſtone-Jugs, kept little order in breaking, and Metals none at all, but Woods cleave with the Grain.</p>
                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:59609:685"/>
                     <p>Two oval Boxes, one of Box and another of Maple, containing each two ounces, were fill'd full, and by the Froſt in one Night were cracked from the bottom to the top. A Pepper-Box of <hi>Latin,</hi> had its neck broke off and the joints at the bottom looſned. Lead-Pipes above ground were broke in many places, and ſome that lay a foot under ground: Braſs-Locks and Barrels of Pumps uſually break with the Froſt. A Copper-Box of the ſhape of a Pear was cracked the fourth time it was froze. The Cylinder of a ſilver Ink-horn bore the Froſt, but a ſilver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball was conſiderably extended by the Froſt. Tobacco-Pipes and Earthen Ware were burſt with the Froſt, and Tiles of Houſes and ſtone-Buildings ſcale upon a thaw; for which Reaſon the North ſide of Buildings firſt decay. Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſter and Marble that have chinks in them u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually break with the Froſt, but ſolid Marble does not, nor does Froſt affect thoſe ſtones or Bitumens which will bear a Poliſh.</p>
                     <p>Ice laid on a Table, and having Salt ſtrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it, it ſtuck ſo faſt that it could not be ſeparated without being broke in pieces; and the Salt made its way through the Ice down to the board; but if Salt be ſtrowed betwixt the Ice and the board, it will not be froze to it but thawed. The following Salts cauſe not ſo firm an adheſion as common Salt, <hi>viz. Kelp, Sande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Sal Indus, Gem, Prunel, Armon.</hi> and <hi>Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſhes.</hi> A nail held betwixt my lips could not be remov'd without difficulty and Pain.</p>
                     <p>A Tincture of Cochineel with Spirit of Wine, and another with a little Sea-Salt Water, being froze throughout, retained an equal colour in all
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59609:686"/>Parts, and ſo did a Tincture of <hi>Mades-weed,</hi> and <hi>Indico.</hi> A Decoction of Soot was froze without any Concentration; yet Mr. <hi>Hook,</hi> a worthy Fellow of the Royal Society, hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the contrary effect.</p>
                     <p>Eggs and Apples-froze differed not in weight, nor do Bodies weighed in ſealed Glaſſes. Froſt renders Wood, Iron, Steel and the Bones of Animals, more friable in froſty Weather; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in thoſe that are tainted with the <hi>Lues Venerea.</hi> Froſt preſerves Bodies from Putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and confirms the Tone of Animals, and fattens ſome; it clears the Air, ſo that muſty Stone-Bottles being fill'd with Water and froze, after a Thaw were very ſweet; it likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys Animals and Vegetables, ſo that in <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> nothing but Glaſs grows, as alſo in <hi>Nova Zembla.</hi>

                     <p>In another Experiment, before the Weather-Glaſs was put in, it ſtood at 8 ⅛, but when immerſed in Water it ſunk to 7 ⅝ or 6/8; in half a quarter of an hour in the frigorifick Mixture it ſubſided to 7 ¾, and in an hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low 5, and conſequently within a quarter of the loweſt freezing Mark.</p>
                     <p>Salt which once hath been diſſolv'd, may, by being cryſtallized in an Iron Veſſel, be fit for uſe again. So <hi>March</hi> 29. the Thermoſcope, which in the Air ſtood at 8 ⅞, in Water ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to 8, and in the frigorifick Mixture made of Salt, twice uſed before, it ſubſided to 4 In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; but upon an addition of freſh Water, it roſe gradually.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Arguments alledg'd in favour of its poſitive nature an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note>BEfore I proceed to enumerate what Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be alledged either for the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or privative Nature of Cold, I ſhall briefly intimate, that the word Cold may be either conſidered in reference to the effect ſuch Bodies have upon the Senſory, or upon other Bodies: If in the latter, then in froſty Weather the Sun may be ſaid to warm the Air, becauſe it enables it to melt the Snow, and thaw Ice, as on the contrary, warm Water is ſaid to be cold in reſpect of a Hand that is much hotter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</note>But to paſs on to Arguments in favour of the poſitive nature of Cold: The firſt Argument alledged is, The conſiderable Effects it hath both upon the Senſory and other Bodies; ſo that we may ſumm our Argument up in the words of <hi>Gaſſendus. Ii ſunt frigoris effectus, quales habere Privatio, quae actionis eſt incapax, non poteſt.</hi> To which it is anſwer'd, That Heat and Cold depending only on a greater or leſs degree of motion of the parts of Matter, than thoſe about our Senſory; and all Perceptions being carried to, and diſtinguiſh'd in the Brain, and being various, as that Motion is different, and it being likewiſe conſidered, that when one Body communicates Motion to another, it loſes of its own; it will follow, that when I take a piece of Ice into my Hand, and it is diſſolved by the motion communicated to its Parts, the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59609:690"/>motion which the Humors in my hand loſt, by putting thoſe of the Water into motion; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a ſenſation of Cold; and conſequently there ſeems to be a privation of that motion which before cauſed Heat.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The ſecond Argument.</note>Another Argument alledged for the poſitive Nature of Cold, is this from <hi>Gaſſendus. Cùm per hyemem immittimus manum in labentis flumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis Aquam, quod frigus in ea ſentitur, non poteſt dici mera privatio, aliudque prorſus eſſe apparet, ſentiri aquam frigidam &amp; ſentiri non calidam. Et fac eandem aquam gelari, ſentietur haud dubie fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidior; an dices boc eſſe nihil aliud quam minus calidam ſentiri? Atqui calida jam antea non erat, quomodo ergò potuit minus calida effici?</hi> To which it is anſwer'd, That our Senſories may miſ-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us; as when a Stick is partly immerſed in Water, ſhould we judge of it by what appears to our Senſes, we ſhould conclude it broke; but our Reaſon rectifying the Error of our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, we are ſatisfied it is not: Beſides Senſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may depend on alterations in the internal Parts, as well as on the impreſſions of outward Objects, as in Hunger, Thirſt, Coldneſs in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, and Titilation upon venereal Thoughts; beſides which Argument, that urged againſt the former Objection, may be offer'd againſt this. And ſince Water is not ſo cold as Ice, it may in a Philoſophical Senſe be ſaid to be compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively warmer, and tho' in reſpect of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of our Body it be cold, yet by the ſame reaſon we might conclude warm Water cold, when the Hand is removed out of hot Water into it.</p>
                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:59609:691"/>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">A third.</note>But in favour of the poſitive nature of Cold, it is further offer'd, that Cold is ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into Bodies not hot before.</p>
                     <p>To which it is anſwer'd, That ſince Fluidity conſiſts in an agitation of the inſenſible Parts of a Body, and Heat in a tumultuary one; thoſe Bodies into which Cold is introduced by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelation, differ whilſt they are fluid, only in degrees of motion from Heat; and even when Water is froze it is not abſolutely and perfectly cold; ſince the Ball of a Weather-Glaſs being immerſed in a Glaſs of Water, and taken out when the Water was froze about it (the Glaſs having been before tallow'd over, to make it part with the Ice) the Ice being broken off the Ball of the Weather-Glaſs, the Air which was colder cauſed the Liquor to ſubſide. And that there may be ſenſible Perceptions of ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Privation of the impreſſions of outward Objects appears, ſince we perceive a ſenſible privation of Light when the Moon is eclipſed nine Digits, and a more ſenſible one when it is totally darkned.</p>
                     <p>But tho' I argue for the privative nature of Cold, yet I would not be thought to mean, that an abſolute Privation of Motion is the cauſe of it, and by which it is affected; for I rather think them the occaſion, than the efficient cauſe; the motion of the Blood and Humours being differently modifyed, upon a privation of their motion, and conſequently a different Senſation impreſſed upon the Senſory; and that a Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the motion of ſome Parts of matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our Senſory may occaſion a new Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Motion of thoſe Fluids, may be
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59609:691"/>inferr'd from eaſy Obſervations; for a Tennis-Ball is variouſly determined in its motion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Angle of Incidence upon another Body; and tho' the Arches of a Bridge be qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcent Bodies, yet by throwing the Water to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they render its Stream violent enough to turn Mills; and even the rapid motion of a Bullet may receive a new determination of its motion, by ſtriking upon the ſurface of the Water, if, when it was firſt diſcharg'd, it made a ſharp Angle with the Water, ſo that its An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle of Incidence might not be too blunt; and that various effects may enſue a Privation of ſome principal cauſe of former Events, appears further from obſerving, that by ſtopping the motion of Water, a Mill preſently ceaſes to move, tho' no poſitive violence be offer'd to it: And upon a relaxation of the violence of Wind, all that was perform'd by the Mill preſently ceaſes for want of Wind: And in Paralytick ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, a viſcous or narcotic Humour obſtructing or diſaffecting one part of a Nerve, ſo that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits cannot freely circulate through it, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſeveral odd and terrible Symptoms: And Animals included in an Air-Pump dye barely by a privation of Air, tho' nothing elſe is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to diſaffect them. And even Inſects, tho' void of motion upon a privation of Air, yet when it is again let into them, they move about as the advantages of their Species enables them; ſo that from what hath been ſaid it appears, that a privation of the Agitation of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours may occaſion a contrary, and probably the effects aſcribed to Cold.</p>

                        <note place="margin">A fourth.</note>The next Argument alledged by <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> and to be conſidered is this. <hi>Fac manuum im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitti in aquam nunc calidam, nunc frigidam, quamobrem manus intra iſtam, non intra illam refrigeratur?

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">A fifth.</note>And tho' it be urged by ſome in favour of the poſitive Nature of Cold, that Water is froze by externally applying to the outſide of a Glaſs a Mixture of Snow and Salt; yet to ſhew that Argument proves not that Cold acts poſitively, I ſhall add the following explication of <hi>des Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. Quia materia ſubtilis, partibus bujus aquae circumfuſa craſſior aut minus ſubtilis, &amp; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenter plus virium habens, quam illa quae circa nivis partes herebat, locum illius occupat, dum par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes nivis liqueſcendo partibus ſalis circumvolvun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. Facilius enim per ſalſae aquae quam per dulcis poros movetur, &amp; perpetuo ex corpore uno, in aliud
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59609:692"/>tranſire nititur, ut ad ea loca perveniat in quibus mortui ſuo minus reſiſtitur, quo ipſo materia ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilior ex nive in aquam penetrat, ut egredienti ſuccedat, &amp; quum non ſatis valida fit, ad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuandam agitationem hujus aquae illam concreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere ſinit.</hi> And in a ſimilar manner Calces or Precipitates, or other Powders, are dryed by being placed on a piece of Paper, not that that acts poſitively upon them, but imbibes the moiſture. And I have ſeen a Cold Liquor acquire a hardneſs, its moiſture being imbibed by a piece of Bread immerſed in it; as alſo Spirit of Wine dephlegmed by a Mixture of Salt of Tartar, without ſo much as Heat, the Aqueous Parts finding a more ready and eaſie paſſage into the Pores of the Alkaly, than through the Spiritous Liquor. And I know a ſaline Body, which when incorporated with Water, the Water will leave this a conſiſtent maſs, and be imbibed by the Spirit of Wine. And for a further illuſtration of the <hi>Carteſian</hi> Explication, I ſhall add, that Camphire by float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> will become a fluid Oyl, and continue in that form till the ſubtle Spirit, which, by pervading it, kept it fluid, flyes away and evaporates; for being put into Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Spirit leaving the Camphire, and being imbibed into the Pores of the Water, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a conſiſtent maſs again, which, that it depended not on the Coldneſs of the Water was evident, ſince the ſame would happen on warm Water. But tho' Cold ſhould depend prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily on the influence of frigorifick Atoms, yet ſince thoſe by acting on the Body cooled, may produce their effect by expelling calorifick Atoms, the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:59609:693"/>privation of thoſe calorifick Atoms, is the cauſe of freezing; ſo tho' a Bullet kills a Man, yet the iſſue is a privation of life; and when a Room is darkned by extinguiſhing the light, the darkneſs depends on the privation of light.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">A ſixth.</note>The laſt Argument of <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> is this, <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metſi multa videantur ex ſola caloris abſentia frigeſcere, nibil ominus niſi frigus extrinſicus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducatur, non tam profectô frigeſcere quam deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcere ſunt Cenſenda.

                     </p>
                     <p>But to this it may be anſwered, that if we ſpeak of Coldneſs with reſpect to ſenſe, I ſee not why any Body that grows hot by the action of the fire may not be ſaid, to grow Cold ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than <hi>Decaleſcere,</hi> ſince Heat being only too brisk an agitation for our Senſory, when upon a removal of that Cauſe, and a declining of that motion, it became leſs agitated than the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours about our Senſory, we may not then ſay it grows Colder and Colder till it become Ice.</p>
                     <p>But to conclude this Chapter, I ſhall add, that tho' I have offered theſe Arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> yet I ſhall wave determining the Controverſie till further ſatisfied in ſome Speculations, and in the Phaenomena of ſome Particular Experiments; beſides I would firſt know, from thoſe that would have Cold to be

As alſo <hi>what</hi> is their Texture, and <hi>whether</hi> that Quality may be deſtroy'd; and <hi>whether</hi> they be primitive Bodies or not? And <hi>why</hi> Coldneſs enſues the Mixture of two warm Bodies. And in order to the ſolving of ſome of which it would be requiſite to enquire, how Water comes by its expanſive force upon congelation? And ſince Cold is a Privation of motion, <hi>why</hi> upon the Mixture of certain Bodies Cold enſues, tho' their Parts be thereby put into motion.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The firſt Problem.</note>THE firſt Problem I ſhall propoſe is; <hi>how upon the Mixture of two or three Bodies, there ſhould enſue a great and tumultuary agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſmall Parts, and yet even during this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,</hi> not any ſenſible Heat; but <hi>a conſiderable degree of Cold be produced.</hi> Concerning which I ſhall only propoſe the queſtion, whether local motion be not Generical; and whether the figure and ſize of Parts variouſly moved may not be able to cauſe a ſenſation of Heat, and when va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly modify'd, a ſenſe of Cold; or whether the ſenſe of Cold depends not on ſome frigorifick
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:59609:694"/>Atoms which are let loſe in the Ebullition and affect the Senſory, which would otherwiſe perceive a hot ſenſation by the effects of the motion of thoſe Parts, with which cold Aoms are mixed, and which they over-power.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The ſecond Problem.</note>The ſecond Problem is, <hi>Whence the vaſt force of freezing Water proceeds?</hi> For ſince Cold de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on an Imminution of local motion; it is not a little ſtrange how it ſhould be able to break reſiſting Bodies, which require local motion to ſeparate their Parts. And tho' <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> tells us, that they proceed from the ingreſs of frigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifick Atoms; yet till Glaciation ſucceeds, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding Water grows colder gradually, it ſubſides and does not expand: And Spirit of Wine, and Chymical Oyls, the greater degree of Cold they are expoſed to contract the more; and ſome Oyls even when coagulated are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed inſtead of being expanded. And as for what the <hi>Carteſians</hi> offer for the removal of theſe difficulties, it may well be queſtioned how their Eel-like Particles being relaxed and their ſpring weakned, they ſhould be able to expand in ſpite of Oppoſition. So that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that Water when expanded is full of bubbles, I was apt to ſuſpect, that the Air con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them contributed to the effect, and that a conſtipation of the Pores of Water might give them a ſpringineſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The great expanſive force of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter froze.</note>To try the expanſive force of freezing Water, we convey'd a Bladder full of Water into a Braſs Cylinder, and fitting a Plugg to it, upon that we placed a flat Board to hold Weights on, and then the Cylinder being encompaſſed with a frigorifick Mixture, upon the freezing of the Water, in one Experiment the Plugg raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59609:694"/>115 pound, weight and in another 100 pound <hi>Averdupois,</hi> and in a third 254 pound weight.</p>
                     <p>Three ſaline Bodies, each purify'd by the fire, being mixed together,<note place="margin">Of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Cold.</note> produced a cold Efferveſcenſe with a hiſſing noiſe and a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Intumeſcenſe. And in the mean time the Glaſs which contained it would grow cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than before, and gather a Dew on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, which would reach as high as the Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but on the concave bottom of the Glaſs there was no Dew, that being not ſufficiently expoſed to the Air; ſo that the Mixture could not be ſuppoſed to ſweat through the Pores of the Glaſs, ſince it taſted not in the leaſt of ſaline Ingredients: But leaſt our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſhould miſinform us of the degrees of Cold, in this Mixture, we at another time immerſed a Weather-Glaſs, in which the Liquor ſubſided above four Inches lower than in common Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Tho' the Acid Liquor it ſelf, being kept all Night in a Room with Water, was of the ſame temper with it, which appeared by a Weather-Glaſs immerſed in both ſucceſſively. And the Salt it ſelf being caſt into Water ſcarce made it ſenſibly colder; nor did the Glaſs wherein this Salt was kept diſcloſe any remarkable degree of Coldneſs. And even the frigorifick Mixture it ſelf, when the Ebullition was over, appear'd not colder than common Water in a Night's time; ſo that the Coldneſs depended purely upon the Texture of the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting Liquor.</p>

                     <p>And to this I ſhall add, that tho' I made uſe of a Spirit that was drawn off at the ſame time with this Salt, and which in the Judgment of my ſenſes appeared to be of the ſame kind, yet inſtead of a cold Ebullition, it produced a Luke-warm Heat. And to theſe I ſhall fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſubjoyn, that tho' the Liquor above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd would produce a cold Ferment with the dry Salt, yet with the Spirit it grew warm; tho' ſome of the ſame frigorifick Spirit kept warm by the fire till the Liquor in the Weather-Glaſs roſe, yet upon the injecting of ſome of the dry'd Salt it would be manifeſtly depreſſed.

                     <p>And to this Experiment I ſhall add, that Salt of Tartar mix'd with Spirit of Vinegar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, upon their Ebullition, a degree of Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs greater than that of Water, and when a Weather-Glaſs was removed out of Water into it an hour after the ferment, the Spirit was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed about half an Inch; tho' Salt of Pot-aſhes mix'd with Spirit of Vinegar produced Heat, as appeared by the ſame Weather-Glaſs ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively immerſed in either.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, That the Motion be more rapid than in Bodies barely fluid; ſo Water becomes hot by an increaſe of the motion of its Parts, which argue their vehement motion by diſſolving Butter, and riſing in the form of Vapours: Which effects are more conſpicuous as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Motion is greater or leſs. Another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to ſhew that the Parts of hot Water are in a more violent agitation than thoſe of cold, is in Water caſt upon a hot Iron; for they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently acquire ſuch an additional Motion from that hot Body, that it hiſſes and boils, yielding Steams copiouſly. But a ſtronger inſtance of the vehement Agitation of the parts of hot Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies is in actual Flame, ſince they move ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuouſly as to diſſolve and ſhatter whatever lies in their way.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond Condition requiſite to render a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hot, is, that the motion of its Parts be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly determined; which variety of Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is apparent in Fire, which produces the ſame effects on the ſame Bodies, whatſoever is their Scituation in reſpect of that Fire; ſo a red
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:59609:696"/>Coal melts Wax, whether held above, below, or on one ſide of it; and that a variouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd Motion is requiſite, appears, if we obſerve that the rapid motion of Water in a River which is only one way, contributes not to the increaſe of its heat.</p>
                     <p>A third requiſite is, that the Parts in ſuch a Motion ſhould be very minute, ſo as to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible; ſince it is manifeſt, that tho' Sand be put into a violent motion, it acquires not a heat by it.</p>
                     <p>This account of heat being conſidered, it will appear, that a Body may become hot as many ways as it is capable of having its parts put into ſuch a Motion: To illuſtrate which Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I ſhall ſubjoin ſome inſtances of the Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Heat ſeveral ways; as firſt by an effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Oyl of Vitriol upon Salt of Tartar, <hi>Aq. fortis</hi> upon Silver.</p>
                     <p>But to paſs over theſe common Inſtances, I ſhall proceed to ſome not ſo frequently known, having firſt taken notice of the Heat which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds an effuſion of cold Water upon Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, which Phaenomenon, tho' it be common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly held to be an effect of an <hi>Antiperiſtaſis,</hi> upon the encloſure of the Lime in cold Water, yet that the effect is produced by another cauſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, ſince the like ſucceeds if hot Water be made uſe of inſtead of Cold; and further, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, tho' Oyl of Turpentine be poured on it cold, no ſuch Effect follows.</p>

                        <p>Others think that the cauſe of the Heat of Quick-lime proceeds from ſome fiery Empyru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Atoms lodged in the ſubſtance of the Stone, when calcin'd, and ſet at liberty in the form of <hi>Effluvia;</hi> but this Hypotheſis is not without ſome difficulties, ſince no ſuch Heat ſucceeds an affuſion of Water upon <hi>Minium,</hi> or <hi>Crocus Martis per ſe,</hi> tho' their increaſe of weight argues that they are ſtuffed with fiery and metalline Particles: To which I ſhall add, that I knew two Liquors, which being ſeveral times ſeparated, and reconjoined without addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, did at each Congreſs acquire a ſenſible heat; ſo Salt of Tartar ſeveral times freed from Water,<note place="margin">The effects of a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Salt of Tartar and Water.</note> will produce Heat when mixed again with that Water; which ſhews that the violence of the Fire is not requiſite to impreſs upon all calcin'd Bodies that will heat with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, what paſſes for an <hi>Empyreum.</hi> And this Phaenomenon I am apt to believe proceeds from
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:59609:697"/>a diſpoſition of the Texture of the Salt being ſtocked with ſtore of igneous Parts, which upon an ingreſs of Water preſſed into the Pores of the Body, by the weight of the Atmoſphere, are apt to break the Texture of that Body, and to put them in motion, ſo as to produce a ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Heat. And that the Ferment depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the peculiar Texture of the Salt, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, and a conſtipation of the Pores of it; ſince <hi>Sal-Armon.</hi> diſſolv'd in Water and boiled to a dry Salt, was not ſo much impregnated with fiery Parts, as to cauſe a Heat upon its mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with Water again, but a conſiderable degree of Cold; and tho' one would expect a greater cognation betwixt the Particles of fire adhering to Quick-lime, and Spirit of Wine wholly inflammable; yet the latter poured up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the former did not produce any ſenſible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caleſcence, or diſſolution of it; and when this Spirit was ſoak'd into it, I poured Water upon it, without perceiving the leaſt Heat or the Lime broken, till within a few hours after; ſo that the Spirit being ſucked into the moſt capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Pores of the Lime, and aſſociating with the Water, rendred it more unfit to penetrate the minuter Pores, and to diſſolve the Lime.</p>

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59609:697"/>which property it retained ſeveral weeks, being kept cloſe from the Air.

To which I ſhall add, that in ſuch diſtillations the Odour of the Spirit hath not only been changed, but its taſte rendered more fiery, and brisk: But the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs is not always the ſame; being diverſified according to difference of the Quick-lime, which may be more or leſs calcined; or the ſtone may be of a different nature it ſelf.</p>

                     <p>But tho' this Mercury grows hot with Gold, yet I much queſtion, whether, as Chymiſts call them, <hi>Mercurii Corporum,</hi> made by extraction from Minerals and Metals, will grow hot with Gold, as I found Antimonial Mercury did. And I am far from affirming, that that which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Philoſophick Mercury, or even thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:59609:702"/>from Gold and Silver are fitter for ſuch uſes, than common Mercury skilfully purged and impregnated with the ſubtle and active Particles of congruous Metals and Minerals.</p>
                     <p>To what hath been ſaid of this Mercury, I ſhall add, that it preſerves its quality of grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hot with Gold two or three Years, and tho' it be diſtill'd from Gold again and again. And whereas its uſual to take eight or ten parts of Quick-ſilver to make an <hi>Amalgama</hi> with Gold; this Mercury would do it, being uſed in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Proportion.</p>
                     <p>As for the manner of preparing this Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I don't think it convenient to publiſh it, only this I ſhall ſay, that it may be made more ways than one, and without employing. Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, or ſuch ſolid Metals as <hi>Mars.</hi> But that of ours, I obſerv'd, ſucceeded beſt, in the production of Heat, by being mixed with <hi>Quercetanus</hi>'s Calx of Gold, <hi>viz.</hi> by melting Gold with three or four parts of Silver; for by putting this into <hi>Aq. fortis</hi> the Silver will be diſſolv'd, and the Gold remain in the form of a Calx. But leſt an Incaleſcence, produc'd by ſuch a Calx, ſhould be ſuppoſed to proceed from ſaline Particles of the <hi>Aq. fortis</hi> working on the Quick-ſilver, I ſhall add, that it will not produce ſuch an effect on common Quick-ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; but ours will cauſe an Incaleſcence even with pure Leaf-Gold.</p>

In which Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, it gained four grains and a half. And the Experiment being again repeated, the Metal acquired eleven grains and a half. And that it may not be thought that the increaſe of weight depended upon Particles of Glaſs diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and fixed upon the Calces, I ſhall add, that I ſeveral times expoſed Glaſſes to the fire without perceiving any conſiderable alteration in the weight of the Glaſs.</p>

NB. But leſt it ſhould be thought, that the Particles of the Flame, which increaſed the weight of the Metal, were turned into Metal, I weighed the Calces in Air and Water, and found, that whereas Lead is to its Bulk of Water as 11 ½ to 1, this Calx was but as 9 to 1.</p>
                        <p>From which Experiments it appears, that Metal receives an increaſe of Weight from Flame, and that too, through the Pores of Glaſs. But tho' I believe that Glaſs is penetrable to the Parts of Flame, yet I am far from thinking that
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:59609:707"/>it is pervious either to Chymical Liquors, Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver, or Air.</p>
                        <p>And this I ſhall add, that it may be worth while to conſider, whether all the parts of Fire are fine enough to penetrate Glaſs, ſince Metals acquire not ſo much weight when ſhut up in Glaſſes, as when expoſed to the open Fire. And it may be likewiſe conſider'd, whether the Pores of Glaſs are naturally large enough to give way to the Fire's igneous Particles, or whether their Heat and rapid Motion does not enlarge the Pores of the Glaſs, and contribute to their Penetration of it: For I know a <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> which will not work upon a Metal whilſt cold; but when hot it will reduce it to a Powder. And on this occaſion I ſhall add, that 'till I am further ſatisfied, I ſhall forbear to determine, whether the Rectitude of the Pores of Glaſs contributes to the Perviouſneſs of it, and whether metalline Veſſels are pervious to the ponderable parts of Flame, or not. Having laid down theſe doubts, I ſhall thence deduce the following Corollaries.</p>

                        <p>From our Experiments it appears, that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies may be calcin'd, without having the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of their Subſtance driven away, and only the <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> and ſome fixed Salts; remaining behind, as the generality of Chymiſts and Philoſophers teach; ſince it is evident, that in our Tryal, no conſiderable Particles flew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but that the Metal gains more than it lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. And hence we may have reaſon to judge of the erroneous opinion of thoſe who ſuppoſe <hi>Saccharum Saturni</hi> to be the ſweet Salt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the Spirit, whereas it appears, that it plentifully concurs in the Compoſition of it; ſo that from hence it appears, that the Calx of a Metal, may be in ſome caſes not the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> or <hi>Terra damnata,</hi> but the Magiſtery
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:59609:708"/>of it, ſince the bulk of the Body is preſerved, and it only, with a Solvent acquires a new form. And I have elſewhere made it appear, that the dry Calx of Lead may be turned into a mallea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Metal again, without Flux-powder, or any other Additament.</p>

                        <p>From the foregoing Trials it likewiſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears what will become of the <hi>Epicurean</hi> and <hi>Carteſian</hi> Doctrines of Fire; the one teaching, that tho' Fire may penetrate Glaſs, yet it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes through Metals, without being arreſted by them; and the other, that igneous Particles cannot penetrate Glaſs.</p>
                        <p>Whether Fire is arreſted in Meat as it roaſts or not, I ſhall not undertake to determine; but if it does, it may be conſiderable in reference to Mens Health, to employ Fire which may be leaſt noxious.</p>

                        <p>From hence it likewiſe appears, that ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, ſpirituous, and fugitive a Body as Fire, may by uniting with congruous Parts of Matter, form a ponderous and ſtable Body; and whether the Sun-beams may have the like effect on ſeveral Bodies it works upon, I ſhall leave to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. And I ſhall alſo leave others to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whether all the Particles of Fire and Flame, that are ſubtle and agitated enough to penetrate Glaſs, and faſten themſelves to included Bodies, be reduced by Ignition to the ſame Form, or
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:59609:709"/>elſe retain ſomewhat of their proper Qualities, only I ſhall add, that in ſuch kind of Inquiries it may be of uſe to compare the ſpecifick gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Calces of Metals, made in Glaſſes, by the operation of Flames, whoſe Fuels are of very different Natures.</p>

                     <p>BEfore I lay down the Experiments, I ſhall firſt proceed to offer the Difficulties which occurr'd in the Tryals; and firſt, that ſome of them in which the Burning-Glaſs was employ'd, I could only try them in clear Sun-ſhining Days, the concentred Rays of the Sun being otherwiſe inconveniently reflected and partly refracted. Secondly, Where I was forced to employ hot Irons, if the Cavity of the Receiver was large, the Iron would be cold before the Air was exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted; but if it was ſmall, the Cement would be melted; ſo that I was forced to make uſe of a peculiar ſort of Cement, which was not ſo ſubject to be melted.</p>
                     <p>But to theſe difficulties I ſhall add, that we muſt not be too apt to conclude, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver in theſe caſes is exhauſted ſufficiently, when the Mercury in the Gage is depreſſed; ſince that may happen upon the account of the Air expanded by the Heat of the Iron; and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59609:709"/>therefore the Air is to be exhauſted, 'till the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury in the Gage can be depreſſed no lower.</p>
                     <p>But if it ſhould be asked, whether a <hi>Vacuum</hi> may not more conveniently and ſpeedily be made by Mercury, in the <hi>Torrecellian</hi> Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? I ſhall anſwer, That tho' the <hi>Vacuum</hi> be more nimbly made, yet the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there are apt to be influenc'd by ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricated Particles of Air expanding themſelves, it being impoſſible to leave that ſpace wholly void of Air; beſides it appears by a Bubble being broke in my Engin, that it exhauſts the Air more clearly than Mercury; ſince in a <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum</hi> made by the latter, the Air included in a Bubble was never able to expand it ſelf pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully enough to break it. Beſides, there is one conveniency in our Engin, that, as Air ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricates it ſelf, it may be drawn out by plying the Engin as occaſion requires, whereas in the <hi>Torrecellian</hi> Experiment, the <hi>Vacuum</hi> is made all at once; beſides the Mercurial Tube is not ſo proper for the following Experiments as our Engin is.

                        <item>1. It ſhone in ſeveral places; thoſe ſhining ſpots varying likewiſe in bigneſs and form.</item>
                        <item>2. The Parts which ſhone moſt were thoſe griſly or bony places which the Butcher's clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had paſt. And we perceived likewiſe that the <hi>Medulla Spinalis</hi> did ſhine. One place of a Tendon ſhone, and ſeveral ſpots in the fleſh diſtant from the Bone.</item>
                        <item>3. By the light afforded by theſe ſpots, I could diſcern ſeveral Letters in the Title of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical Tranſactions; the moſt vivid Rays being of a greeniſh blue, like the tails of Glow-worms.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:59609:720"/>Neither a Weather-Glaſs or the touch could diſcover any more Heat in thoſe Parts than in others; nor were they in the leaſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid.</item>
                        <item>4. The window of the Larder is Northward; and the floor a ſtory below the Kitchen, and ſeparated from it only by a Boarded floor.</item>
                        <item>5. The Wind was high, and South-weſt, the Air being hot for the ſeaſon. The Moon was paſt its laſt quarter, and the Mercury in the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rometer ſtood at 29 1/16 Inches.</item>
                        <item>6. A piece of a ſhinning bone being cut off the thickneſs of half a Crown ſhone on both ſides, and the place it was cut off ſhone likewiſe but more faintly.</item>
                        <item>7. The Fleſh loſt ſome of its light by rubbing; but imparted no light to my hand: But the Fleſh being preſſed betwixt two pieces of Fleſh it loſt nothing of it's Light.</item>
                        <item>8. A piece of it, having lain a quarter of an hour in inflamable Spirit of Wine loſt its Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minouſneſs; but in Water it continued an hour without being impaired.

                        <hi>CHAP. XXIII.</hi> Obſervations of a Diamond that ſhines in the dark.</head>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amonds.</note>HAving met with a Diamond, which, tho' it would not yield light in the day, would afford a conſpicuous light in the Night, I thought it would be of no ſmall uſe in explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the abſtruſe Nature of Light. And tho' a great many think it no rarity, that there are Carbuncles and Diamonds which ſhine in the dark, yet there are ſome who deny, that there are any ſhining ſtones at all, as <hi>Boetius de Boot; Johannes de Laet,</hi> and <hi>Olaus Wormius,</hi> yet <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temannus</hi> and <hi>Garcias ab Horto,</hi> pretend to be Eye witneſſes of Carbuncles which ſhone in the dark; and <hi>Marcus Paulus Venetus</hi> tells us, that the King of <hi>Zeilan</hi> had a Rubie as thick as a Man's arm, and a Palm long. And two <hi>Ruſſian Coſſacks</hi> tell us, that they heard from the People of <hi>Cottay,</hi> that their King had a Rubie which would ſhine Night and Day. And <hi>Benvonuto Cellini,</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> Writer, gives us an account of a Carbuncle which affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a conſiderable Light in the Night. And we our ſelves have been informed of a ſhining ſubſtance found in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And I am further told, that a <hi>Dutch</hi> Admiral had a Diamond, which when he opened a Coffer under Deck in a dark Room, would ſhine by its native Light, which is the more ſtrange, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that is a much colder Climate than the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi> for it is obſervable, that warmth
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:59609:721"/>much contributes to the ſhining of ſuch ſtones, ſince rubbing will cauſe ſome to ſhine, which when cold will not; which makes me the leſs doubt of what is ſaid of right <hi>Turquois, viz.</hi> That it changes colour as the wearer is ſick or well, and loſes its ſplendor after Death, which is atteſted by the Obſervations of <hi>Boetius de Boot,</hi> and <hi>Olaus Wormius;</hi> and tho' <hi>Antonio N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ri</hi> tells us, that a <hi>Turquois</hi> diſcoloured and grown white, will regain its colour, if immerſed in Oyl of ſweet Almonds, yet <hi>Wormius</hi> tells us, that a Nephritick ſtone being dipped in a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of herbs loſt its virtue. And it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that the Texture of <hi>Oculus Mundi</hi> will be ſo changed by being left in Water, that from Opacous it will become Tranſparent, which acquired luſtre it will ſoon loſe in the Air.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obſervations made on Mr.</hi> Clayton's <hi>Diamond.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was a flat Table Diamond ⅓ of an Inch long, and leſs in breadth, of a bad Water, and leſs vivid in the day than other Diamonds, being blemiſhed with a whitiſh Cloud about the middle of it, which blemiſh covered near a third part of the ſtone.</p>
                     <p>This Diamond being looked upon in a ſhady place in the day, and alſo with a Microſcope, neither any thing peculiar in the ſtone, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny light was perceived.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, when the Candle was removed in a dark Room, it did not ſhine without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rubbed or otherwiſe prepared.</p>
                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:59609:721"/>
                     <p>Thirdly, I could neither produce Light by rubbing together two Pebbles, nor by a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment attrition of Rock-Cryſtal, nor by two Diamonds, as by this ſtone.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, it was hard enough to grave upon Rock-Chryſtal with it, and was endewed with an Electricity.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, by rubbing it in the dark, it would be excited to ſhine like rotten wood, but much fainter than the ſcales or ſlabber of a Whiting, or than Glow-worms; and it preſently ceaſed after the attrition was ended. But being rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed briskſly it would continue its Light much longer, ſo that it laſted eight times as long as it was a rubbing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sixthly, holding it near a faint fire excited its Luciferous Qualities a little, but by holding it near a Candle it was more apparently excited in a dark Room; and it acquired a little glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by being held near a red piece of Iron, as alſo by being contiguous to my naked Body ſometime.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, by being rubbed till it acquired Luciferous Qualities, it was alſo Electrical, but not when it was excited to ſhine by the Heat of the Fire or a Candle.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, attrition varied its Luciferous Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, as the Cloath varied in colour; but on white and red it ſucceeded beſt. It was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe excited in ſome meaſure by being rubbed upon a white wooden Box; and a purely glazed Earth, which excited it much better than any other Body except white ones.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, when it was excited, being plunged into Water, Spirit of Wine, Oyls of all ſorts,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:59609:722"/>Acid Spirits, and Alkalizate Solutions, none of them deſtroyed its ſhining properties, but when it was taken out of the Water it was not ſo eaſily excited as before.</p>
                     <p>Tenthly, neither Spittle nor warm Liquors would extinguiſh its Light; but being rubbed with a tranſparent horn, I could diſcover Light through it, and ſometimes little ſparks of fire.</p>
                     <p>Eleventhly, being rubbed upon a blue Glaſs, the faint Light was not viſible through it, but being firſt excited and then applyed to the Glaſs, the Rays were tinged in their paſſage through it.</p>
                     <p>Twelfthly, by preſſing it hard upon a piece of white Tyle it became Luminous, as alſo it diſcovered a ſhort Coruſcation when I preſſed my finger upon it: And if I thruſt or ſtuck the point of a Bodkin againſt it, it would diſcover a ſhort, but not a laſting Coruſcation, ſo that its Light ſeemed to be promoted by preſſure ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than attrition.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Experiments being tryed with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther precious Stones, ſome Diamonds would by attrition be brought to a glimmering Light, but others would not; but neither the other precious Stones, nor Artificial or Natural Chryſtal would afford the leaſt glimmering of Light.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Of an Aerial <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiluca.</hi>
                        </note>
                        <hi>PHoſphorus</hi>'s are either natural, as Glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms, ſome ſorts of rotten Wood and Fiſhes; or artificial, which are the chief ſubject of this diſcourſe; and are either, Firſt, ſuch as will retain a Lucidneſs ſometime after they have been expoſed to the Sun-Beams, as the <hi>Bolonian Stone,</hi> and <hi>Phoſphorus Hermeticus</hi> of <hi>Balduinus,</hi> which may be made of Chalk, the latter of which ſucceeds much better than the former; for it is preſently excited in the Sun-Beams, and even at the flame of a Candle, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to ſhine a conſiderable time in the dark; yet this advantage the <hi>Bolonian</hi> Stone hath above the other, that it retains its Virtue of being excited much longer. Or, Secondly, ſelf-ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubſtances, ſuch as are uſually called <hi>Nocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luca;</hi> and are either conſiſtent or liquid, ſuch as Mr. <hi>Crafft</hi> brought to <hi>London,</hi> the conſiſtent one being of a gummy Nature and conſtantly lucid; but the other apt to vaniſh, if expoſed to the open Air. To which I ſhall add, one of my own preparation, which does not ſhine it ſelf, but when expoſed to the Air, the <hi>Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi> mixing with it became lucid, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I call the Aerial <hi>Noctiluca:</hi> In preparing of which, from ſome Parts of a Man's Body, it was not only difficult to hit upon the true degree of Heat, but the Veſſels in which it
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:59609:723"/>was raiſed by Diſtillation, being not able to hold out ſo long as they ſhould, we were forced to ſave the Luciferous matter, by ſmall parcels and in diſtinct Vials.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obſervations made on the Liquor which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the ſecond Vial, which tho' it was large enough to contain two ounces, had but a ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the Liquor in it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. By Day-light this ſhining Liquor was not near Diaphanous, but of a muddy grayiſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. And when it was diſpoſed to ſhine in the dark, the Cavity of the Vial above the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor ſeemed to be full of whitiſh fumes, tho' at other times tranſparent.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Vial when cloſe ſtopped was not Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous in the dark, but the <hi>Light</hi> or <hi>Flame</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared as ſoon as it was expoſed to the Air, and the Vial was unſtopped; and that the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion and Propagation of this Flame depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the contact of the Air, appeared, ſince agitation would not kindle it, but when the Bottle was unſtopped the kindled Flame would gradually be propagated downwards; and if a few Bubbles of Air were only let in by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the cork aſide and putting it cloſe in again, the Flame would appear upon the top of the fumes, without being able to propagate it ſelf much downwards. To which Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I ſhall add, that when the Flame appeared it was moſt vivid the nearer the Air, and when it was extinguiſhed, it firſt diſappeared in the bottom, and then expired at the top. But when the Vial had been unſtopped for
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:59609:723"/>ſome time, when it was ſtopped again, the Air that had leiſurely inſinuated it ſelf would cheriſh the Flame for an hour or two.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It was obſervable, that when the Air had been long pen'd up with this ſhining Liquor, the ſpring of it would be ſo far weakned, that when the Vial was unſtopped, the external Air would preſently ruſh in again, from whence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears the Intereſt of the Air, in promoting the ſhining of this Acry <hi>Noctiluca.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Of the Reaſon of <hi>Noctiluca's</hi>
                        </note>As for the Reaſon why the Air ſhould<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to ſuch Phaenomena, I ſhall offer the following Conjectures, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Saline Parts of the Air, cauſed a Fermentation in the fumes of the Liquor, by which means, they being briskly agitated, are either convey'd to, or unite with the common, <hi>Aether,</hi> and affect the Eye joyntly; and tho' Mr. <hi>Craft</hi>'s conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent <hi>Noctiluca</hi> ſhines when cloſed up from the Air, yet that may be attributed partly to the Viſcouſneſs of the Luciferous matter, which is leſs apt to be diſſipated; which I am the apter to believe, ſince it being once expoſed to the open Air, it was conſiderably waſted and was rendered much more violent; ſo that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced conſiderable effects of actual Heat. But tho' I am inclined to believe that the Air con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes thus to the ſhining of theſe <hi>Noctiluca's,</hi> by putting the Particles of the fumes into a brisk agitation, yet whether it acts immediately on the fumid matter it invades, or whether it diſſipates it, or acts after the manner of a Vital Spirit, or further, whether the Air uniting with theſe fumes forms a Body fit to be agitated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:59609:724"/>by the <hi>Aether,</hi> I ſhall leave to be further inquired into. But to return to our Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Tho' agitation before the Vial was unſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped would not kindle the Light; yet when it was opened, it would be increaſed by it. And even when it was in its dark ſtate, if I poured a little of it upon my hand, and rubbed it with my finger, it would preſently become vivid, and emit ſtore of Luminous Rays, as well as fumes very offenſive to the Noſtrils; and when I ceaſed to rub, and the Luminous Quality was loſt, it would be renewed again by a repeated attrition; but in a little time its lucid Virtue would decay.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. As for the degree of the Light of this Luminous matter, it was equal with that of ſome rotten wood; and it was obſervable, that the Rays of it were reflected but weakly by black Bodies, but appeared very lucid when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed in white ones, tho' I could not perceive the Rays of it reflected from a rediſh Diamond or an Emerauld. This Light in reſpect of it ſelf was Opacous, but tranſparent when held near external Light, and interpoſed betwixt it and the Eye.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. I tryed whether the Sun-Beams would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite thoſe fumes, which are Concomitants of its Luminouſneſs, but could not perceive them rais'd in the leaſt. As for the Nature of this Liquor I could not perceive it upon my Tongue either Acid or Alkalizate, but Empyreumatical, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt like that of Spirit of crude Tartar, its ſmell being like that of an Empyreumatical Oyl, compounded with a ſtink like that of
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:59609:724"/>ſtale Urine. It turned not Syrup of Violets green, as volatil Alkalies, or urinous Salts do; nor did it by other Tryals appear to be an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. This Liquor in its lucid State being agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſeveral conſiſtent Particles being by that Agitation raiſed, and ſticking to the ſides of the Glaſs, appeared to be more lucid than the Fumes. Having wet my Finger with this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, and rubbed it upon my Hand 'till it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came luminous, I immerſed my Finger in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, upon which the Light was extinguiſhed; but when I took it out of the Water, and rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed it again, it became lucid as before.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. But twice I obſerv'd, that there was ſuch a peculiar Temper in the Air, that it continu'd to flame twelve or fifteen Hours after it had been ſtopped up. And at laſt this Liquor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo effaete, that it would not yield Light, 'till its Parts were agitated by Attrition, or put into motion by the Heat of the Fire.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. To what Obſervations have been already made, I ſhall add the following, made on the Liquor contain'd in the firſt Vial.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obſervations on the Liquor contained in the firſt Vial.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Liquor being muddy ſhone ten hours after it was firſt poured into the Vial, and when the Vial was unſtopped the Fumes were put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a circular Motion round the ſides of the Glaſs, like a Whirl-wind; which perhaps might depend in ſome meaſure on the violent Ingreſs of Air, upon opening the Vial; tho' I have
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:59609:725"/>ſometimes obſerv'd lucid Rotations of Matter in the Cavity of the Vial, a conſiderable time after ſuch Eruptions.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Flames which were afforded by rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing theſe Liquors, yielded white Fumes of a rank offenſive Smell; the Colour of the Flame being yellow, and tremulous in their Motion, and inconſtant, ſometimes flaſhing out more than at other times; but it neither burnt the Skin, nor ſinged fine Linnen: So that if any, it muſt reſemble that <hi>Flamma Vitalis</hi> which is ſuppoſed to reſide in Animals.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A Pencil being dipped in this Liquor, and drawn upon white Paper, depoſed only its wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try part; but the more gummy Matter in the Pencil being ſqueezed out, it ſeemed to burn like a Candle, and ſometimes ſhooting down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as if it were played about the Hairs that made up that part of the Pencil, which brought into my Mind thoſe Verſes of <hi>Virgil,</hi>

                     <p>And it was obſervable, that this Flame would ſucceſſively appear and diſappear for a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable time, and ſometimes when the wreathing of the Hairs was violent, the Flame would be accompany'd with a momentary, tho' ſenſible Heat, yet it would not fire Gun-powder; tho' ſome of the conſiſtent Matter, whilſt it was preparing, being taken out with a Knife, and the Knife rubbed betwixt the Thumb and Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers with a blue <hi>Calico</hi> Apron, the Matter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:59609:725"/>ſuch an Impreſſion from that Attrition, as put its parts into ſo violent a Motion, that two Holes were burnt in the Apron. Some of the Liquor contained in the Receiver, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with Water, turned Syrup of Violets green, and fermented with Acids.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Some of this Liquor being contained in a Vial, and convey'd into our Pneumatick Engin, tho' the Air could not be ſo far exhauſted, but that there was a ſufficient quantity left behind to kindle the Flame; yet the Commotion occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd by Pumping, would be, as if it were ventilated, or blown up, and made to ſhine more vividly. And a piece of Paper moiſten'd with this Liquor, being convey'd into a Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, tho' by the Commotion of the Receiver, the Flame ſeemed to be ſtill increaſed, yet in thoſe Parts betwixt the Folds it appeared to be much leſs than in the open Air; and tho' when moiſt Air was let in again the Flame was extinguiſh'd, yet upon a removal of the Receiver, when the Paper was expoſed to the open Air it renewed its Flame.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Some of this Liquor being at the firſt fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, the Subſtance remaining in the Filtre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing encloſed with it in a wide-mouthed Glaſs, it became luminous when expoſed to the Air. And another piece of Paper being ſhut up in another Glaſs, when it was ſpread open in a dark Place, ſeveral Flaſhes ſprang out inceſſantly and ſucceſſively, firſt in one place then in another, and were not only various in their Figures, but had frequent Emications and Tremblings.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Some of this luciferous Matter being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd in an aqueous Liquor, which was tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparent
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:59609:726"/>when it was ſetled, tho' a moderate A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation would not produce Light in it, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet in a Sand-heat in a Bolt-head 'till the Ball was too hot to be touched with ones hand, I cauſed it to be removed into a dark place, and found that it had acquir'd a manifeſt Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſs, and the Liquor being variouſly agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and broke, ſeveral Flakes of Light aſcended to the top of the Stem; and when the Liquor was agitated 'till it was ſpread over the inſide of the Ball and part of the Stem, it was adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with luciferous parts of Matter, which twinkled like ſo many Stars, and deſcended in Lines, ſome of which were very oblique and pleaſant.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Once I obſerv'd, that when the Liquor contain'd in a Bolt-Glaſs was not very hot, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given it a rude ſhake, a Spark roſe on one ſide, and ſpread all over the Cavity of the Ball. And to what hath been obſerv'd, I ſhall add, that ſome of this Liquor was having been hermeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſealed up, it retain'd its luciferous Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties a long time.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The way to make the <hi>Phoſphorus Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duini,</hi> is the following, <hi>viz.</hi> Having diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved fine white Chalk in Spirit of Nitre, or clean <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> it muſt be filtred through Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paper, and the clear Solution is to be evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 'till there remains a dry ſubſtance; which being ſpread over the inſide of a round Veſſel which will endure the Fire, you are to give it a peculiar degree of Heat; and which commonly requires a convenient ſhaped Veſſel, whereby the Flame or Heat may be reverberated, 'till the Matter hath acquired a diſpoſition to retain
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:59609:726"/>
                        <hi>Light;</hi> and then the Veſſel muſt be covered with a Glaſs or fine Cryſtal Cover, to keep it from the outward Air.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The Proceſs which we took to make our Aery <hi>Noctiluca</hi> was the following; We took a conſiderable quantity of putrified Urine; which was diſtill'd 'till all the ſpirituous Parts were drawn off; after which the ſuperfluous moiſture was alſo abſtracted, 'till the remaining Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was brought to the Conſiſtence of a thick Syrup, which being well incorporated, with three times its Weight of white Sand, the Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was put into a ſtrong Retort, to which a large Receiver was joined in a good meaſure filled with Water: Then the two Veſſels being carefully luted together, and a naked Fire being gradually adminiſtred for five or ſix Hours, that the Phlegmatick or Volatil Parts might come over firſt. When this was done, the Fire was increaſed, and at the length for five or ſix Hours, made as ſtrong and intenſe as the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace was capable of giving; by which means good ſtore of white Fumes came over, almoſt like thoſe that appear in the Diſtillation of Oyl of Vitriol, which when they are paſt, and the Receiver grew clear, they were after a while ſucceeded by another ſort, which ſeemed, in the Receiver, to give a faint blueiſh Light, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt like that of little burning Matches, dipt in Sulphur. And laſt of all, the Fire being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vehement, a more ponderous Subſtance paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed over, which fell to the bottom of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which being taken out, appeared to be luciferous. But whether the ſhining Faculty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the volatil and ſpirituous Parts of this
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:59609:727"/>Animal Liquor, or of the fixed Salt, and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous faetid Oyl, I ſhall not determine, 'till further ſatisfy'd by Obſervations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An Appendix to the Aeerial</hi> Noctiluca.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Some luciferous Matter, that had a long time loſt its ſhining Faculty, being heated by the Fire, preſently ſhone vividly enough, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd to do ſo whilſt it was ſufficiently warm; but in a few Weeks, it likewiſe loſt this Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Heating. And tho' ſome conſiſtent Matter had loſt its Power of ſhining, yet the Superficies being taken off, the Matter that lay under it rubbed upon my Hand would preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly become luminous.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Tho' this luminous Matter be not fecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, yet it uſually leaves ſome of its gummy Parts ſticking to the ſides of the Vial, which may be diſcover'd by heating the Vial, or if it be broke in pieces, and agitated in another Veſſel; for by that means, the Parts being rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed one againſt another, and variouſly placed with their ſides upwards and downwards, they would every way diffuſe a clear Light.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A twelfth part of a Vial being filled with a liquid <hi>Phoſphorus</hi> of another kind, ſo that a greater quantity of Air might be contained in it, it continu'd to ſhine without unſtopping the Vial. And I ſometimes obſerv'd ſeveral Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations like Clouds, or Aggregates of Smoak, to roll to and fro in the Cavity of the Veſſel; and would grow much more lucid upon ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Vial.</p>
                     <pb n="255" facs="tcp:59609:727"/>
                     <p n="4">4. When it had loſt its Light for ſome time, it filled the Cavity of the Vial, when unſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, with Fumes, which like thoſe of the other <hi>Noctiluca's,</hi> appeared white in the Light, and luminous in the Dark. A Bolt-head half full of this luminous Matter being ſealed up herme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically, it continued luminous ſix Days and Nights; and when a great part of the Liquor was poured off, the remaining Sediment being ſpread about the ſides of the Glaſs, by inverting it, they appeared like ſo many bright twinkling Stars in a clear Night.</p>

                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:59609:728"/>
                     <p n="2">2. This <hi>Noctiluca</hi> is heavier in Specie than Water; and tho' conſiſtent, yet not ſo hard as common Ice; but it is brittle, and may be ſpread upon a ſolid Body, like the unmelted Tallow of a Candle, it may be melted in hot Liquors without waſte, but in the Air a great Part of it will be conſumed. As to ſenſe it is Cold; but is of ſuch a Texture that it eaſily becomes hot upon agitation.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When held in the Air it yields a vivid Light if wet over, and when firſt expoſed to the Air, it not only ſhines, but emits ſtore of <hi>Effluvia,</hi> as long as it is kept there; when it is immerſed in Water it ceaſes to ſhine and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to ſmoak, but as ſoon as it is taken out, it begins a-freſh, and if part be immerſed and part above Water, the latter will ſhine vividly tho' the other will not.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of Water in which it had been immerſed.</note>4. The Water in which this <hi>Noctiluca</hi> had been ſometime immerſed, had a ſtrong and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrant taſte like a Mixture of Brine and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Salt, and reliſhed a little of Vitriol. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing held in a ſmall Concave Veſſel of Silver o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lighted Coals and aſhes, it evaporated ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſlowly, and would not ſhoot into Cryſtals, nor afford a dry Salt; but coagulated into a ſubſtance like a Gelly, or the whites of Eggs, which would be eaſily melted by Heat. When kept on a hot fire it would firſt boil, and then make a crackling Noiſe, and the Exploſions would be accompanyed with flaſhes of fire and light, which if they were ſmall were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally blue, like flames of Sulphur, but more vivid, and ſometimes bluer; but the greater flakes appeared yellow and very Luminous,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:59609:728"/>and theſe Phaenomena appeared likewiſe for ſome time after the Veſſel was taken off. When this matter was almoſt melted by Heat, if it was permitted to cool, it acquir'd a roſinous Conſiſtence, and tinged the Flame of a Candle blue. By the Fire working upon it, it acquir'd a Garlick Smell, and being left in the Air all Night, it turned to a Liquor almoſt as ſtrong as Spirit of Salt. Being put upon the Fire again, it would afford the ſame Phaenomena as before, but ſome of the Matter which before broke out in Flaſhes, ſometimes roſe only in the form of Smoak, of a rank Smell. And tho' the quantity of this Matter was ſmall, yet it afforded Flaſhes plentifully for an Hour.</p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <note place="margin">What Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors it would be diſſolved in, and what not.</note>It would not diſſolve in cold Water, tho' the Water would be thereby impregnated; ſo <hi>Crocus Metallorum</hi> impregnates Wine or Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, without having its Bulk diminiſh'd. It fermented not with Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armon.</hi> nor did it loſe its luminous Virtue, but would ſhine when expoſed to the Air again. Oyl of Vitriol when cold would not diſſolve it, but when hot would melt it; and it would lye at the bottom of ſo heavy a Liquor. <hi>Aqu. fortis</hi> had no viſible effect on it, nor Oyl of Turpentine when cold; but the latter being hot, it wholly vaniſh'd in a Night's time, without making any alteration in the Oyl. Being put into Oyl of Cloves, and melted by a Fire, when it was cool, and the Vial unſtopped, it yielded not only a Light, that was render'd more acceptable to the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders-by, by its grateful Smell; and the like ſucceeded with Oyl of Cloves, in which Liquor, when impregnated with the <hi>Noctiluca,</hi> it was
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:59609:729"/>obſervable, that the Vial being open'd in a dark place, it would yield a flaſh of Flame very vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, which would laſt a Minute; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, if a Candle were in the Room, the ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fluid would appear of a pleaſant blueiſh Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; and another thing obſervable was, that the Light would vaniſh, whilſt ſtore of white Fumes remain'd upon the Liquor, as if the Light chiefly depended on the fineſt and pureſt Part. In Oyl of Mace it did not appear luminous, nor in Oyl of Aniſeeds. This <hi>Noctiluca</hi> continu'd in Spirit of Wine, a conſiderable time undimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. This <hi>Noctiluca</hi> being included in rectify'd Spirit of Wine, was partly diſſolved; and left ſome earthly Parts at the bottom of the Liquor, but did not diſcolour it: upon unſtopping the Vial no Light appeared, but being dropped into cold Water, the Drops were kindled by it; but thoſe Flaſhes immediately diſappeared, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not being luminous; which Phaenomenon, leſt it ſhould be thought to be an effect of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiperiſtaſis,</hi> I dropped the impregnated Spirit upon hot Water, and found, that the ſame Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon ſucceeded. And this <hi>Noctiluca</hi> diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes its Virtue ſo far, that one Grain impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a thouſand of Spirit of Wine. As for the reaſon why theſe Flaſhes ſo ſuddenly diſappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it might proceed from a ſudden diſperſion of the Particles of the Spirit through the Water, and the Avolition of the luciferous Matter. So Camphire diſſolv'd in Spirit of Wine, and drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped upon cold Water, is left upon the Surface of it, the Spirit being immediately diſperſed through the Liquor.</p>
                     <pb n="259" facs="tcp:59609:729"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Experiments diſcovering a ſtrange ſubtlety of Parts in the Glacial</hi> Noctiluca.</p>
                     <p>Having diſſolv'd a Grain of our <hi>Noctiluca</hi> in a Drachm of Spirit of Wine, and added gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually fifty times its weight of Water, the <hi>Noctiluca</hi> rendred the whole light, when ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the Dark, ſo that one Grain rendred 100000 times its weight of Liquor luminous; and what was more ſtrange, was, that not only the Steams appeared luminous, but the Light ſeemed in ſome meaſure diffuſed through the whole Water, which I am apt to believe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the Exhalations which ſhined through that Diaphanous Water, tho' when the Glaſs was ſhaken the whole Maſs appeared lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous. And the Experiment being further proſecuted, a Grain of the <hi>Noctiluca</hi> diſſolved in Alkohol of Wine, and ſhaken in Water, it render'd 400000 times its weight luminous throughout. And at another Tryal I found, that it impregnated 500000 times its weight; which was more than one part of Cochineel could communicate its Colour to, the utmoſt being 125000 parts of Water. In which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, ⅛ of the <hi>Noctiluca</hi> was undiſſolv'd. And had we to the aforemention'd Eſtimate, added the Proportion of the illuminated ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Air, the Expanſion of this <hi>Noctiluca</hi> would have been incomparably greater than the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd number denotes.</p>
                     <p>But to demonſtrate further the ſtrange Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of our Noctilucal Matter, I ſhall add, that three Grains of our <hi>Noctiluca</hi> being placed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:59609:730"/>a flat-bottom'd Glaſs, that was broader at the Top than the bottom, and ſhallow, that the Matter might be more fully expoſed to the Air, it was placed in a ſhelving Poſture, that upon its reſolution in the moiſt Air, it might preſently run down, and not hinder the free Evaporation of the remaining Matter: The Veſſel being thus placed, all the Fragments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ten a Clock at Night began to ſhine brisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and continu'd to do ſo 'till reduced to very ſmall Parts; ſo that ſo ſmall a parcel of our <hi>Noctiluca</hi> continued to ſhine above a hundred and fifty Hours. In which time the following Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances were obſervable,
<list>
                           <item>Firſt, That the luciferous Fumes were viſible both Night and Day; and roſe from the Particles of the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiluca,</hi> like Smoak from ſo many Chimneys.</item>
                           <item>Secondly, This Smoak was ſo copious and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious, that it loſt not that Form 'till it roſe a Foot above the Matter that afforded it; the Motion of it being ſwift, and ſometimes tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directly upwards, ſometimes horizontally, and ſometimes downwards, as if their Motion had been determin'd by the ſcituation of the Noctilucal Fragments, by which they were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</item>
                        </list> And one thing further obſervable was, that when it had been a long time expoſed to the Air it emitted ſtrong and odorous Exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, diſtinct from the viſible Fumes.</p>
                     <p>As for the Liquor which dropped from this <hi>Noctiluca,</hi> and which remained in the Glaſs Veſſel, I put it into a Concave Silver Veſſel, and held it over Small-Coals and Aſhes, where it evaporated not ſo eaſily as I expected, but turned into an unctuous Subſtance, of a dark red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:59609:730"/>Colour; and being thence removed and held over quick Coals, it boiled and crackled like Bay-Salt caſt into the Fire, and emitted ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſucceſſive Flaſhes. Another piece of this <hi>Noctiluca,</hi> which weighed three Grains, being put into a ſmall Glaſs Funnel, whoſe Stem was ſo fine that it was leſs than a ſmall Pin's head, and the Pipe of the Funnel being purpoſely pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in a Vial, to catch the colliquated Liquor; and this being ſet in a South-Window all Day, and placed in my Chamber at Night, I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that it continued luminous no leſs than 360 Hours. From whence appear'd the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Minuteneſs of the parts of our <hi>Nocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luca;</hi> and what is more ſtrange, the Weight of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>r Noctilucous Matter colliquated, exceeded the Weight of the <hi>Noctiluca</hi> it ſelf two thirds.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Noctiluca</hi> being ſpread upon Paper, and held to the Flame of a Candle, when the Flame came to the <hi>Noctiluca,</hi> it burnt away in a fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing and ſpluttering manner, and cracked like Salt. And ſome of this Paper being put upon Embers cover'd with Aſhes, the <hi>Noctiluca</hi> would take Fire, and communicate its Flame to the Paper. And to ſhew its inflamability further, I put a Grain of it into Spirit of Wine, and tho' it diſcolour'd not the Flame of the Spirit, which was partly red and partly blue, yet when the Spirit was conſumed, and the Flame was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous to the immerſed <hi>Phoſphorus,</hi> it took Fire, and emitted a yellow Flame copiouſly. And a piece of this being ſet on fire by the Sun-beams concentrated, it burnt very vividly and clear; and the expiring Flame left behind it a <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> which formed ſeveral Circles like
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:59609:731"/>thoſe of a <hi>Sardonix,</hi> whereof the largeſt was white, another yellow, and the third red, all the three Colours being vivid and pleaſant. Some part of the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> being left in the Spoon, was preſently reſolv'd <hi>per deliquium,</hi> into a Liquor as ſharp as Spirit of Salt; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts having free acceſs to the Air appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed combuſtible.</p>
                     <p>Another inſtance of the Inflammability of it, was by rubbing it in a Mortar, for by that means it took Fire, and burnt vividly, but was ſoon extinguiſh'd by the Fire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Of the burning of Bodies with the <hi>Nocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luca.</hi>
                        </note>If our <hi>Noctiluca</hi> be preſſed hard betwixt ones Fingers, or againſt a Board, it will feel ſenſibly hot; and will ſometimes be violent enough to ſcorch the Skin: And one thing obſervable is, that Bliſters raiſed by its Heat, are not only more painful, but harder to be cured than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ones. But tho' ſome parts of this <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiluca</hi> are diſpoſed to take Flame, yet they are not all equally prone to an Incaleſcence. To theſe Obſervations of our <hi>Noctiluca</hi> I ſhall add, that ſome of it being rubbed betwixt Folds of Paper for ſome time, they took Fire, and ſo did it when rubbed with Gun-powder, by which means the Gunpowder was exploded: And once when my Servant carried ſome of it in his Pocket, the Glaſs being broke, the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition and Heat of his Body ſet it on Fire, by which means ſeveral Holes were burnt in his Breeches. To which I ſhall ſubjoin, that ſix Parts of Sulphur, and one of this being mixed and beaten with the haft of a Knife, the <hi>Nocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luca</hi> ſhone through the Paper, and as ſoon as theſe Ingredients were expoſed to the Flame, they
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:59609:731"/>immediately took Fire; and once the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being repeated, the Brimſtone did not burn with a ſlow Flame, but flaſhed away like Gun-powder. And once my <hi>Laborant</hi> having prepared ſome of it, and trying to write upon a dry Board, the force of Attrition kindled the Wood, and afforded not only vividly ſhining, but burning Letters.</p>
                     <p>To try what was the Nature of this ſaline Noctilucal Matter, I dropped ſome of it upon Syrup of Violets, and found that it did not turn it green, but of a fine Carnation Colour, as Acid Spirits uſually do. And I likewiſe found, that it preſently deſtroy'd the blue Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, tho' not the other of the <hi>Lignum Nephri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticum.</hi> I likewiſe poured ſome of this Noctilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous Liquor upon Filings of Copper, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to the Air for two or three Days, I found, that tho' the Filings were diſſolv'd, yet the Colour of the Tincture was not a deep <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure,</hi> as if made with a Volatil Urinous Salt, but ſeemed to partake of green and blue. It likewiſe fermented with Powder of red Coral, and alſo with Salt of Tartar. From whence it appears, that the nature of our Salt is not Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, but of the Family of Acids. But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, I encloſed a parcel of this Icy <hi>Noctiluca</hi> in a ſmall Vial, and another, together with the Water it came over with in Diſtillation, and I obſerv'd, that the former loſt its Light in four Days, and the other in about a Week. But to try whether a ſufficient Degree of Heat would not cauſe our <hi>Noctiluca</hi> to take Fire, I encloſed ſome of it in a Glaſs-Egg, with <hi>Hermes</hi> his Seal, and found, that the Ball of the Egg being held
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:59609:732"/>near the Fire, the <hi>Noctiluca</hi> preſently took Flame and burnt much longer than we expected; and when the Flame was over, we ſometimes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd a little Liquor in the Glaſs, the reſt of the Matter, by the Operation of the Fire, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring a red Colour.</p>
                     <p>Some of this <hi>Noctiluca</hi> being put into a Glaſs Egg, and Water poured upon it, when the Water was heated very hot, and the <hi>Noctiluca</hi> was melted, we poured the Water off; upon which the <hi>Noctiluca</hi> remaining in the Glaſs, immediately being expoſed to the Air, took Flame, and part of it running out with the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, burnt fiercely upon the Surface of it, and with a crackling Noiſe, the remaining <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> appearing red. To which relations I ſhall add, that the Beams of this <hi>Noctiluca,</hi> paſſing through an Orange colour'd Glaſs, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd of a very pleaſant Colour. And on this occaſion I ſhall ſubjoin, that tho' once I could not obtain any Light from ſome of this <hi>Nocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luca</hi> included in a Vial with Oyl of Mace, as with Oyl of Cinamon, yet upon further Tryals, I found that it ſucceeded. And to what hath been deliver'd on this Subject, I ſhall further add, when the <hi>Noctiluca</hi> was wholly conſum'd to a <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> that as ſoon as it was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the other ſide upwards, it would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately take Fire a-freſh.</p>

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:59609:733"/>account ſpecifically lighter than Water, the Water by the Preſſure of that which is incumbent, get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting betwixt the Superficies of the Veſſel, and the Body immerſed, cauſes it to riſe, the Water which ſucceeds it in its place making a more powerful Preſſure againſt it, than its Specifick Gravity enables it to reſiſt. And that Bodies Specifically lighter than Water will be thus buoyed up by it, will appear from the Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatical Paradoxes hereafter to be laid down.</p>
                     <p>And tho' it be uſually urged, that the Bodies im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>immerſed are too cloſely contiguous to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Veſſel for the Water to inſinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves betwixt; yet from the following Experiment it will appear, that were the contiguous Surfaces ſo cloſe, the poſitive Levity of the Wood would not be able to raiſe it; for two black Marbles, being ſo exactly poliſhed as to be as contiguous as poſſibly they might, we tyed a Bladder full of Air to the uppermoſt, and then cauſing them both to be immerſed in Water, the poſitive Levity of the Bladder, would not cauſe the Bladder to riſe; but as ſoon as by a ſervant the uppermoſt Marble was gradually ſlipped half off the Poliſhed Surface of the loweſt, the Water which before was not able to inſinuate it ſelf betwixt the Surfaces of the contiguous Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and to ſeparate them, preſently cauſed the Bladder to riſe with a conſiderable ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and force, above the Surface of the Water: Which Event, that it did not depend on Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's abhorrency of a <hi>Vacuum</hi> is evident, ſince that would have an equal force when the Poliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Surfaces were wholly contiguous, the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Nature's abhorrency of a <hi>Vacuum</hi> being
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:59609:733"/>held by its Aſſertors to be unlimited. And that it was not the heavineſs of the upper Marble, nor want of lightneſs in the included, appeared, ſince when the Surfaces of the poliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Marbles were not contiguous, the Bladder was able to lift up a weight of ſix or ſeven pound, beſides the Marble.</p>
                     <p>And to ſhew, that the Bladder might be raiſed by the Preſſure of the Water, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the laws of Hydroſtaticks uſually buoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up Bodies Specifically lighter than it ſelf, having preſſed out the greateſt part of the Air contained in a Bladder, I tyed a piece of Iron to it, and immerſed it in a wide-mouth'd Glaſs, which was ſo deep that the Bladder was total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly immerſed, and yet not far below the Surface of the Water, and this being convey'd into our Pneumatick Engine, when by exhauſting the Air part of the Preſſure was taken off, the Air in the Bladder expanding it ſelf, and take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up more Room in the Water, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently becoming ſo much more Specifically lighter, and the reſiſtance of the Water which endeavours to buoy it up becoming reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly greater, it was together with the ſuſpended weight, raiſed to the Surface of the Water, and continued there till the outward Air was let in again; and then the Air being contracted into its former dimenſions, it ſubſided again. In which Experiment the poſitive Levity of the Air was not varyed, but only its relative and reſpective weight in reference to its proportion of Water.</p>
                     <p>And that Rarefaction alters not the poſitive Levity of Bodies, may appear from the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:59609:734"/>Experiment; for having oyled a Bladder, and when the Air was expreſſed, tyed it to the neck of a Vial, I found, that in the exhauſted Receiver, tho' the Air in the Vial was ſo far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded as to fill the whole capacity of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, yet the Vial neither roſe higher; nor ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideded lower when the Air was drawn out, or let in again.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Of the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the differing weight of the Atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere on Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies under Water.</note>COnſidering that the Pores of moſt Liquors are plentifully ſtocked with Aery Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and that upon that account the Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere may according to its ſeveral degrees of weight have conſiderable Effects on them, I cauſed three ſmall Glaſs-Bubbles with ſlender Stems to be blown, which were ſo equally poiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Water by their weight, that a little thing would make them emerge or ſink. And I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, that theſe being put into Water con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in a wide-mouth'd Glaſs, ſometimes they would emerge and ſometimes ſubſide, and ſometimes emerge again, as the Atmoſphere va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed in weight or degrees of Heat and Cold.</p>
                     <p>And it was eaſie to obſerve, that when the Heat of the Air raiſed one of theſe Bubbles, the heat of the Sun-Beams would ſo rariſie the Water included in them, as to cauſe ſome of it to get out, upon which the Bubbles emerged, but when thoſe Beams were intercepted, the Water being condenſed, and getting into the Bubble again, it would ſubſide. But when their ſubſiding depended on the weight of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere, if the Mercury in the Baroſcope ſtood high, the Heat of the Sun would not raiſe the Bubbles.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. The Succeſs did not always anſwer, for when the ſubſiding depended on ſome occult cauſe, they would continue there, as if ſome airy Parts had inſinuated themſelves into the Water.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids and Fluids.</note>ONE great reaſon why ſome Learned Men believe that the Air hath no ſuch a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Preſſure on ſubjacent Bodies as we teach, is, becauſe they think it would be too heavy for Animal Bodies to live or move under it; but ſince we have poſitive proof of it, we may as well doubt whether the Load-ſtone be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed with an attracting and other Virtues, becauſe we cannot underſtand how they are perform'd. Beſides, Men being born under ſuch a Preſſure, their Bodies ſeem not only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd to it, but proportionably ſtrong. But could we ſuppoſe a Man born ſomewhere,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:59609:736"/>without the incumbent weight of an Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere, doubtleſs ſuch Bodies would not be ſo able as ours to reſiſt its Preſſure.</p>
                     <p>But it is urged by ſome, that were there ſuch a Preſſure of the Atmoſphere, it would cauſe Pain; but to this it may likewiſe be anſwered, that our Bodies being from the Birth accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it, we only feel Pain upon ſome new unaccuſtomed and additional Preſſure; ſo when we are accuſtomed to wear heavy Cloaths, we are not ſenſible of their weight, nor are we ſenſible of the Heat of the Blood in our Heart, becauſe it's habitual to thoſe Parts, whereas if our finger be put into the Heart of a newly diſſected Animal, we ſhall find it ſenſibly hot.</p>
                     <p>But further, from what I have elſewhere laid down, it appears, that a Cubick Inch of Air will be able to reſiſt the weight of the whole incumbent Atmoſphere, and that a little quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Air reſiſts a further compreſſion as well as a greater; and I have likewiſe ſhewn, that the Pores of the Parts of Animals whether fluid or conſiſtent, are plentifully ſtocked with numerous Aerial Bubbles, which cauſe thoſe Bodies to ſwell or expand in our exhauſted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver. And as for thoſe membranous and fibrous Parts which are not altogether ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, they are of ſo ſtrong and firm a Texture, as to reſiſt external Preſſure upon that account. Beſides, there is a great deal of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the partial Preſſure of a ſolid Body, and the Preſſure of an Ambient Fluid, which preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes uniformly, and is reſiſted either by the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of the Parts, or the Spring of thoſe Airy
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:59609:737"/>Particles contained within their Pores. And that the uniformneſs of the Preſſure makes it leſs ſenſible, is evident, ſince it hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that tho' the Atmoſphere is ſo much lighter upon the tops of ſome high Mountains, as not to elevate Mercury ſo high in a Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope by three Inches, as at the bottom, yet thoſe that have been upon thoſe Mountains tell us, that they perceived no conſiderable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the Preſſure of the Atmoſphere above and below; nor are Miners ſenſible of any great weight upon them, tho' in deep Mines in Mountainous Countrys; nor are <hi>Divers</hi> ſenſible of any Preſſure when under Water; but that Air weighs in Air, and that Water weighs in Water, I have elſewhere made it evident; yet I don't think that a <hi>Diver</hi> is violently depreſſed by the weight of the incumbent Water, ſince from what we have elſewhere delivered it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that if a Man's Body were of an equal ſpecifick Gravity with the Water, the ſubjacent Water would ſuſtain him, but his Body being heavier than an equal bulk of Water, the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſage of weight depreſſes it; for which Reaſon, in ſome Sea-Water, which is near of the ſame ſpecifick Gravity with their Bodies, <hi>Divers</hi> find it very difficult to dive. However it is not a little ſtrange, that at ſo great a depth as one hundred fathom <hi>Divers</hi> ſhould not perceive a ſenſible Preſſure, eſpecially upon their Thorax and Abdomen: But I am apt to believe that the inadvertency of ſome of them, rather than any thing elſe makes them not take notice of it; or elſe the haſte which they riſe and ſink in; ſince I have been told by ſome,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:59609:737"/>that they have perceived a manifeſt Preſſure when they ſunk leiſurely. And I was likewiſe told by another, that when he deſcended a great depth under Water, the Blood was ſqueez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of his Noſe and Eyes; and another who dived in a Leathern-caſe told me, that it was ſo much preſſed againſt his Thorax and Belly, that he was forced ſuddenly to come up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                     <p>But ſince theſe Relations are not altogether to be relied on, I ſhall endeavour to give a Reaſon why the Preſſure is no more ſenſible; which I take to be the ſtrong Texture of a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Body, and the uniformity of the Preſſure. As to the firſt, to what I have ſaid of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance made by our Bodies to external Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, I ſhall only add, that a Bladder being ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the end of a Cylinder, about an Inch in Diameter, when the Air was exhauſted, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent Preſſure of the Atmoſphere was not able to break it, tho' when a Man's hand was placed there, he was not able to raiſe it till ſome of the Air was let in again, the Preſſure which held his hand down being equivalent to a Cylinder of Water thirty foot high. But to ſhew the effects of an uniform Preſſure of Liquids upon Solids contained in them, I ſhall ſubjoyn the following Tryals.</p>
                     <div type="experiment">
                        <head>EXPERIMENT I, II, and III.</head>
                        <p>Having placed an Egg betwixt two Bladders half blown, in a Braſs Cylinder, and cautiouſly put a Plug upon them, with as much weight upon it as amounted to thirty pound, I placed
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:59609:738"/>them all in a Receiver, and when the Air was exhauſted, tho' the expanding Bladders muſt needs preſs equally againſt the Egg and the Plug, yet the incumbent weight was raiſed, and the Egg when taken out as whole as before; the weight it ſuſtained in the Cylinder being not quite ſo much as the weight of the Atmoſphere. But tho' the Egg was able to ſuſtain ſo much weight when preſſed upon uniformly; yet Weights being ſucceſſively laid upon the ſame Egg expoſed to the open Air, four Pound weight cruſhed it in pieces. And by further Tryals we found, that an Egg-ſhell, which had all the Yelk and White taken out, as alſo a thin Glaſs Bubble, being placed betwixt two Bladders, as in the firſt Experiment, neither of them was in the leaſt cracked.</p>

                     <div type="experiment">
                        <head>EXPERIMENT IV.</head>
                        <p>To ſhew that what we have taught of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Fluids, will hold in Water as well as Air, if the Preſſure be uniform, we encloſed an Egg in a Bladder almoſt full of Water, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it into the Braſs Cylinder, we heaped up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Plug as many Weights as amounted to ſeventy five pound, yet the Egg being taken out, was as found as when firſt put in. In which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance it cannot be pretended, that the Egg bore no weight, by thoſe that allow not Water to gravitate in Water, ſince there was a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Preſſure made by Metalline Weights, which every body allows to weigh in Water. From this Experiment, and the other before mention'd, of an Egg being broke by a partial
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:59609:738"/>Preſſure, it appears, that the Strength of the Texture of a Humane Body, together with the Uniformity of the Preſſure of ambient Water, may be the reaſons why <hi>Divers</hi> feel no greater Inconveniency under Water; for tho' their <hi>Thorax</hi> may be a little more compreſſed than other Parts, yet that Part being naturally dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and contracted, a little Preſſure may make no ſenſible Alteration: But I have been told by a <hi>Diver,</hi> that at a conſicerable Depth, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a painful Preſſure upon the Drums of his Ears, 'till he contriv'd a way to guard them from that Inconveniency; the reaſon of which Phaenomenon ſeemed to be no other, than that in that Part there was not an equal internal Preſſure, to reſiſt and counterballance the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Preſſure of the Water.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>A Bubble about the bigneſs of a Pullet's Egg, with a long Stem turned upo at the end, was heated; and, when the Air was moſt of it expelled, ſealed up; and then being by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient weight of Lead immerſed under Water, it was ſuſpended at the end of a Ballance, and counterpoiſed; and then the Apex of the Stem being broke off with a Forceps, ſo much
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:59609:739"/>Water got into the Cavity of the Bubble, as required four drachms and thirty eight grains to reduce the Ballance to an <hi>Aequilibrium.</hi> Which being done, we drove out the Water by the help of a Flame of a Candle into another Glaſs, which was counterpoſed, and we found that it weighed four drachms and thirty grains, which together with what was evaporated and loſt, and the weight of the Apex, amounted to the weight firſt mention'd. So that from hence it appears, that Water weights as much in Water, as it does in the open Air; which according to the beſt Computation we could make, ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſecond time in a larger Bubble.</p>
                     <p>As for the Objections which Mr. <hi>George Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clair</hi> hath made to this Experiment, ſince it is the Opinion of our Author, that he only dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from him in Expreſſions, I ſhall wave what he there ſays, as not at all requiſite in this Place; and ſhall only add what our Author hath ſaid, to explain what he means by Water weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Water, <hi>viz.</hi> That it gravitates or weighs, in as much as it tends downwards, upon the account of its ſpecifick Weight, tho' it does not preponderate, that is, the Parcel of Water weighed hath but an equal Tendency down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with the Ambient Water, but upon an additional Weight it preponderates as much as the additional weight increaſes its Tendency towards the Center.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Hydroſtatical Paradoxes made out by new Experiments.</head>
                     <p>BEfore I procced to the Hydroſtatical Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes, I ſhall briefly intimate, that tho' I can readily aſſent to the Hydroſtatical Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons laid down in Monſieur <hi>Paſchall</hi>'s Diſcourſe; yet as for the Experiments he makes uſe of to prove them by, I muſt own, I am not ſatisfy'd with them; ſince he makes uſe of ſuch as require that a Man ſhould ſit under Water fifteen or twenty Foot, with the end of a Tube leaning upon his Thigh. But he neither acquaints us how a Man ſhall be able to continue there, or how he ſhall diſcern the alterations in the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury or other Bodies, at the bottom. Beſides, ſuch Experiments as he propoſes require Tubes twenty foot long, and Veſſels as many foot deep, which are hard to be got in <hi>England;</hi> nor is it poſſible to obtain from a Tradeſman, Braſs Cylinders or Pluggs, made with ſo much Mathematical Exactneſs as he propoſes.</p>
                     <p>Having therefore contriv'd a more eaſy way to demonſtrate the Truths contain'd in the foregoing Paradoxes; before I proceed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine them, I ſhall premiſe a word or two by way of <hi>Poſtulatum</hi> or a <hi>Lemma;</hi> which conſiſts of three Parts: The firſt of which is, That if a Pipe open at both ends, and held perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to the Horizon, have the lower of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Water, there paſſes an imaginary Plain, which touching the Orifice of the Pipe, is pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:59609:740"/>to the Horizon, and likewiſe, as to ſenſe, to the upper Surface of the Water. To which it will be conſonant, ſecondly, that as long as the Surface of the Water is even, the Water incumbent on this Plain will equally preſs on all the parts of it. But, thirdly, if there be a greater Preſſure on one part of this Plain than another, as when a Stone preſſes upon it, the Water which lyes under that Stone will be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed, as the Stone ſubſides ſucceſſively, 'till it come to the Bottom. But on the contrary, if there be leſs Preſſure on one part of that Plain than on another, the Liquor will be raiſed on that part ſo high, 'till the Liquor on that part of the Plain gravitates equally as the Water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on the other parts of it; which will appear from the following Experiments.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, If a Cylindrical Pipe open at both ends, be held in a perpendicular Poſture, and the lower end be immerſed three Inches in Water, the Liquid within the Tube having a free Communication, will be of an equal height with the external Water, and in thin Tubes, a little higher. But if Oyl be gradually poured upon the Water without the Pipe, the ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Plain will have a greater Preſſure upon it without than within, and conſequently the Water under the Tube, finding not ſo great a Preſſure within the Pipe as without, it gradually riſes, 'till the external and internal Preſſure upon the imaginary Plain be equal.</p>
                     <p>But ſince this will be further evident from what is contain'd in the following Paradoxes, I ſhall proceed to them, as ſoon as I have laid down the following Experiments, to ſhew Air
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:59609:740"/>is not a Body devoid of Weight, as ſome <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateticks</hi> ſuppoſe. The firſt is, that a Glaſs Bubble being blown, whoſe Capacity was ſhort of two cubical Inches, it was inſtantly herme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically ſealed, whilſt hot; and when it was cool, being placed in a nice pair of Scales, and then the Apex of the Stem being broke off, the Air ruſhing in with a noiſe, cauſed the Bubble to preponderate half a Grain, tho' by breaking of the Stem under Water, it appear'd that the rarify'd Air remaining in the ſealed Glaſs, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd one fourth of its Capacity. Another time the ſame Experiment being tryed, the Air contain'd ſeem'd to weigh near three quarters of a Grain; and the Capacity of the Receiver being filled with common Water, it weighed 905 Grains: So that allowing the Air contain'd to take up one fourth, and that the weight of the remaining Part was ¼, probably the weight of the whole was about a Grain; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Water weighed little more than nine hundred times as much as an equal Bulk of Air.</p>

                           </note> A B C D (ſee Plate the ſecond, Fig. the firſt) a Cylindrical Tube be immerſed, which contains Oyl of Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine; and that Oyl be ſuſpended there, (by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the upper Orifice cloſe, after it hath been ſuck'd up to a convenient height) 'till the Pipe
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:59609:741"/>is depreſs'd to a convenient Depth in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; if the lower end of the Pipe B Q be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſed 'till it reaches to the imaginary Surface G H, and the Oyl X Q preſſes no more upon that imaginary Surface, than the Water with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Tube, then the Oyl will be ſuſpended there, and not be able to depreſs the Surface of the Water below it; but if the Surface of the Oyl in the Tube be much above the Water, and it preſſes more upon the imaginary Surface G H than the Water without, then it will make its way through that Surface, 'till the Oyl within and the Water without are brought to an <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilibrium</hi> again, ſo that they both equally preſs upon the Surface G H; and the like will hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, if the Tube be raiſed to the Surface D S, and gradually on to the Surface L M; for as the Preſſure of the external Water grows leſs and leſs, as the imaginary Surface is nearer the top of the Glaſs, ſo the Oyl in the Tube grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preponderant, falls out at the lower end of the Tube, 'till the Tube T V being almoſt raiſed to the Surface L M, but a little Water preſſing upon that Surface, the Oyl is almoſt wholly fallen out of the Cylindrical Cavity of it. But if inſtead of raiſing the Pipe P Q, it be depreſſed to the Poſition N O, the Water incumbent on the Surface E F on the outſide the Pipe, being more powerful than the Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or Oyl W AE, which is only aequiponderant to a Cylinder of Water leaning on the Surface G H, the Oyl muſt be buoyed up by the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the external Water, and the Space O AE filled with Water, ſo that the Oyl betwixt W AE, and AE O, being both aequiponderant to a Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:59609:741"/>of Water, they may equally preſs upon the Surface E F with the Water on the outſide. And agreeable to what hath been ſaid it is, that the Cylinder of Oyl X Q will be ſomething above the Surface L M, when the Tube is only immerſed to the Surface Q. Since Oyl of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine being ſpecifically lighter than Water, the Cylinder muſt be longer, to preſs upon the Surface G H, equally with a Cylinder of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, no longer than from the Surface L M to G H. And if a heavier Liquor than Water were made uſe of, the Surface X muſt be more above L M than in Water, otherwiſe it would not preſs equally upon the ſubjacent Surface. From whence appears the Truth of the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, for if the Oyl be kept ſuſpended at a different Height as the external Water is deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to countervail it; and if as it is raiſed from G H to I K, the Oyl in the bottom of the Pipe is preſſed out, it muſt needs follow, that it is preſſed down by the weight of the incumbent Oyl, ſince then the ſurface of the Water I K, being not equally preſſed upon from without, as by the Oyl, it is able to break that Surface and make its way out.</p>
                        <p>But before I proceed to the following Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, I ſhall ſubjoin the following Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements.
<list>
                              <item>Firſt, What we ſay of the Preſſure of Fluids upon one another, is to be attributed to heavy Fluids in general, except ſome reaſon appears for a particular exception in ſome Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</item>
                              <item>Secondly, That in ſlender Pipes the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Liquor within, is generally above the Surface of the external,</item>
                              <item>Thirdly, Small Pipes are the fitteſt for theſe Experiments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:59609:742"/>in larger the emerging Oyl paſſing through the Water obſcures the Light of what is deſign'd to be viſible.</item>
                              <item>Fourthly, We make uſe of Oyl of Turpentine, rather than any other Liquor, becauſe clear and colourleſs, and not apt to ſtain ones Cloaths; and as for the offenſive Smell, that may be corrected with Oyl of <hi>Rhodium,</hi> or any other odoriferous Oyl, tho' any other Liquor may be made uſe of, that will not mix with Water.</item>
                              <item>Fifthly, Oyl of Turpentine may be tinged with Copper, to render the Phaenomena within more viſible; for which reaſon we often employ a Decoction of Braſil inſtead of clear Water, or of Log-wood, or red Ink it ſelf.</item>
                              <item>Sixthly, the Figure of the Glaſſes may be what you pleaſe, but the Pipes muſt be broader or longer as occaſion requires.</item>
                              <item>Seventhly, The Pipes are to be filled by ſucking up the Air to a convenient Height, and then ſtopping the Orifice above with ones Finger; but if it be too high, the Experimenter may let it out as he pleaſes, by admitting a convenient quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Air in at the Top, by gradually remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Finger.</item>
                              <item>Laſtly, In ſuch Experiments as require a conſiderable diſparity betwixt the two mingled Liquors, we may make uſe of Oyl of Tartar <hi>per Deliquium</hi> inſtead of Water, and Spirit of Wine inſtead of Oyl of Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine; theſe Liquors being not diſpoſed to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle with one another; and inſtead of fair Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 06 we may make uſe of a filtred Solution of Sea-Salt, when the other is not eaſily got.</item>
                           </list> And when we have a mind to vary the Experiment, we may make uſe of Oyl of Turpentine along with the other two; and by depreſſing a Tube
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:59609:742"/>into them with Water in the bottom, exhibit very pleaſing Phaenomena.</p>

                        <p>The truth of this is evident, ſince all Bodies have a tendency towards the Center; by which they are always diſpoſed to preſs downwards, tho' ſometimes they have a reſpective Levity, as when a piece of Wood emerges in Water, yet nevertheleſs that relative Levity argues not that it hath no weight at all, ſince tho' when a Man ſtands in a pair of Scales and lifts up a weight, notwithſtaning the Aſcent of the weight he will perceive a manifeſt tendency of it down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                        <p>But to make it more plain (See Plate 2d. Fig. 2.) where ſuppoſing a Cylinder of Water I G,<note place="margin">See Plate <hi>2.</hi> Fig. <hi>2.</hi>
                           </note> to be immerſed in Oyl of Turpentine to the immaginary Surface E F; the Water in the Pipe I H being heavier in Specie than the Oyl, it will equally ponderate upon the Surface E F as the lighter Oyl K E L I, and if the Pipe be immerſed deeper, the Cylinder of Water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not equiponderant with the extenal Oyl, the Oyl will, tho' a lighter Body in Specie, riſe in the bottom of the Tube and buoy up the Water.</p>
                        <p>Again the Bubble X which conſiſts of a Glaſs heavier than Water and Air which is lighter;<note place="margin">See Plate <hi>2.</hi> Fig. <hi>3.</hi>
                           </note> or partly of Water it ſelf which is ſpecifically as heavy, as long as the whole aggregate is
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:59609:743"/>lighter than Water of an equal bulk it will float, but if it grows heavier it will ſink, and if any heavy Body preſſes upon it, which is ſpecifically heavier than Water, by which the included Air may be compreſſed, the Bubble will ſubſide, but when that Preſſure is taken off, and the Air ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pands it ſelf again, it will as ſoon emerge, the Water that was before ſucked in being by that means expelled.</p>
                        <p>But for a further Confirmation of this ſecond Paradox, I ſhall add the following Experiment, <hi>viz.</hi> That having put a Glaſs-Bubble pretty well poiſed, into a Tube filled within a foot of the top with Water, it ſwam there, till a good deal of Oyl of Turpentine was poured upon the Water, but then more Water being forced into the Bubble by the weight of the incumbent Oyl, it preſently ſubſided; but when part of that Oyl was taken off, the ſpring of the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Air forcing the impreſſed Water out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the Bubble preſently immerged. And,</p>
                        <p>For a further Confimation of this Paradox as well as the firſt, I ſhall add, that a Bubble ſwimming in a Tube, as in the former Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, tho' depreſſed to the bottom by a Wier, yet when that Preſſure is taken off again it will riſe up as before; but if it be held under Water till more is poured in, and till it riſes about a foot above it in the Tube, the weight of the incumbent Water will depreſs it, but if that Water be gradually taken off, the Bubble will preſently emerge.</p>
                        <p>If it ſhould be asked why in theſe Tryals I did not make uſe of Oyl of Tartar <hi>per Deliquium,</hi> inſtead of Water? I ſhall anſwer, That in ſuch
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:59609:743"/>ſlender Pipes as the firſt Experiment was made in, as the Oyl of Tartar flowed down one ſide, the Oyl of Turpentine would riſe on the other; which makes me wonder that Monſieur <hi>Paſchall</hi> ſhould teach, that if a Tube filled with Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry be immerſed fourteen foot under Water, if the Tube be fourteen foot long, the Mercury will not wholly run out, but continue to the height of a foot in the bottom of it; and I the more wonder at it, ſince probably the <hi>Impetus</hi> would make it deſcend; and ſince the like would not ſucceed with much more favourable circumſtances, betwixt Oyl of Turpentine and Oyl of Tartar.</p>

                           <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">paradox </seg>3</label> That if a Body contiguous to the Water be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether or in Part lower than the higheſt level of the ſaid Water, the lower part of the Body will be preſſed upward by the Water that touches it beneath.</head>
                        <p>This may be proved from what hath been delivered under the firſt Paradox, for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever an imaginary Surface is beneath the real one, the weight of the Water being incumbent on all other Parts of the ſame Superficies, that part on which the immerſed Body chances to lean muſt have a Proportionable endeavour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; and if that endeavour be greater than the ſpecifick Gravity of the immerſed Body is able to reſiſt, then it is buoyed up; and tho' the Gravity of the immerſed Body is ſo great, as to over-power the tendency of the Water
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:59609:744"/>upwards, yet the tendency of that Water is not therefore to be denyed, for as much as it in ſome meaſure reſiſts the ſubſiding of that Body. And this may be confirmed by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment tryed in the ſecond figure, for as more Oyl is externaly poured on, the Water is impelled and buoyed up in the Pipe by the ſubjacent Oyl, which could not be, if the Oyl did not preſs againſt it beneath; and even when the Water and Oyl are in an <hi>Aequilibrium,</hi> the latter preſſes upwards, in as much as it reſiſts the deſcent of the Water out of the Tube. And the truth of this Propoſition is equally true, whether we ſuſpend Oyl in Water or Water in Oyl.</p>
                        <p>And that the Water makes a reſiſtance to Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that deſcend in it,<note place="margin">See Plate <hi>2.</hi> Fig. <hi>4.</hi>
                           </note> will appear from the following Scheme; for ſuppoſing the Pipe E F to contain Oyl ſpecifically heavier than Water, and when the Oyl and Water without were in an <hi>Aequilibrium,</hi> the Pipe be raiſed, drops of Oyl will fall out, but much more ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than in the open Air, where if the drop G were not ſpecifically heavier than the Water, it would not break the imaginary Surface of the Water H I. But further, it not only from hence appears, that ſince as long as the two Liquors are in <hi>Aequilibrium</hi> they are not able to remove each other out of their places; but from hence we may infer, that a Liquor of an equal ſpecifick Gravity with Water, being placed in any part of that Liquor, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the place aſſigned.</p>
                        <pb n="289" facs="tcp:59609:744"/>
                        <p>But to illuſtrate what we have ſaid, of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter obſtructing the deſcent of Bodies heavier than it ſelf, I ſhall add, that if twelve ounces of Lead be counterpoiſed in the Air, when the Lead is let down below the Surface of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Scale in the Air will manifeſtly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderate; which ſhews that the Water hinders the deſcent of the other. And the reſiſtance of Fluids to the lower ſuperficies of Bodies may be further confirmed by obſerving, that Bodies ſpecifically lighter than Water are raiſed by it, as Wood and drops of Oyl; the Reaſon of which ſeems to be this, that there is a greater Preſſure upon the loweſt part N, than upon the upper part of the drop M, becauſe that upon all the Surface K L there is an uniform Preſſure of the Water A K. B L, and upon all the Parts of the Surface H I there is a greater weight of Water A H. B I, except at the part N, for there the Oyl G, being not ſo heavy as ſo much Water, it is conſequently unable to reſiſt the aſcent of the Water beneath it, for which Reaſon it is buoyed up; and the caſe being the ſame with that and any other Parallel Plain, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is in its aſcent, it muſt be by the ſame Reaſon gradually raiſed up, for the Oyl being preſſed againſt by two Pillars of Water, the one above and the other below, and the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er being longer by the thickneſs of the riſing Body, than that which lyes upon it, it muſt conſequently be buoyed up, and more or leſs ſwiftly as the lower <hi>Baſis</hi> preſſes more or leſs on the ſubjacent ſuperficies.</p>
                        <pb n="290" facs="tcp:59609:745"/>
                        <p>And for the like Reaſon when two pieces of ſtick of a different length are immerſed in Water; the longeſt riſes the faſteſt, for if O P were two foot high, and Q R but one, and both reſted upon the ſame imaginary Plain, the one hath a Pillar of Water a foot longer to reſiſt its riſing than the other, and as the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merging Body riſes ſlower, as the proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the upper and the lower Pillar of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is leſs; ſo thence may be deduced a Reaſon why in ſome Liquors, whoſe whiteneſs depends on the intermixture of drops, are ſo long a riſing, the minuteneſs of them rendering the difference of the upper and lower Pillar of Air inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, but as theſe drops by moving up and down unite into larger, the difference grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more conſiderable, they are accordingly buoyed up in leſs time, and ſwim upon the top of the Water.</p>
                        <p>And for the ſame Reaſon,<note place="margin">See Fig. <hi>3.</hi> Plate <hi>2.</hi>
                           </note> that theſe Bodies float upon Water, a Cubick Inch of Wood is by its ſpecifie Gravity only ſo far depreſſed into the Water contained in the Vial A B. C D, till the Water about it makes an equal Preſſure upon the imaginary Surface X W, and becauſe the Wood is not ſo heavy in Specie as Water, therefore part is kept emerging above the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of it.</p>
                        <p>But to ſhew further, that the weight of a floating Body is equal to as much Water, as its immerſed Port takes up the Room of, I ſhall ſubjoyn, that having placed ſeveral Marks upon the Surface of a floating Glaſs, and, when it was taken off the Water, put juſt ſo much Water into it as filled it up to thoſe Marks, by that

                        <p>The truth of this Paradox ſufficiently appears from what hath been before delivered; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to make it plainer, if poſſible, I ſhall add, that if a tinged Liquor be ſucked up about an Inch into a Tube, and whilſt the upper Orifice is covered with ones Thumb, it be depreſſed in Water till the ſuperficies of the external Water is above the Surface of the internal, and then a conſiderable quantity of Oyl be pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon that, and when ones Thumb is taken off the upper Orifice of the Pipe, the external Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ids will by their Preſſure, raiſe the tinged Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor above the Surface of the Water, tho' not
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:59609:746"/>quite ſo high as the Oyl: From whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that a Liquor may be raiſed in a Tube by the Preſſure of an external fluid, and that lighter than it ſelf in <hi>Specie,</hi> which may illuſtrate what we have ſaid of the riſing of Water in Pumps, where by the Preſſure of the Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere the Water is buoyed up, when the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the incumbent Atmoſphere is taken off the internal ſuperficies by the riſing ſucker, and makes way for the Water to aſcend with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Pipe.</p>
                        <p>I took likewiſe a ſmall Tube, whoſe Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was the ſixth part of an Inch, and having im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſed it an Inch in Quick-ſilver, I put my Thumb upon the upper Orifice, and kept it there till I had immerſed the Tube eighteen Inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in Oyl, by the weight of which preſſing againſt the Quick-ſilver, it was not only kept from fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Pipe, but raiſed a little, and as when the Tube was raiſed ſome of the Mercury would fall out, ſo when it was depreſſed the Mercury would be buoyed up, by the greater weight of the external Liquor upon it. And indeed that the Water in a Pump may be raiſed by the Preſſure of an external fluid, will appear more fully to him that ſhall conſider, that in the Torrecellian Experiment the Preſſure of the external Air is able to raiſe Mercury in a Tube twenty nine or thirty Digits, which is equipon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derant to a Cylinder of Water thirty three or thirty four foot high.</p>

                        <head type="sub">And ſo likewiſe, If the Water that leans upon the Body be contained in Pipes open at both ends, the Preſſure of the Water is to be eſtimated by the weight of a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of Water, whoſe Baſis is equal to the lower Orifice of a Pipe, (which we ſuppoſe to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to the Horizon) and its height equal to a Perpendicular, reaching thence to the top of the Water; tho' the Pipe be much inclined towards the Horizon, or tho' it be irregularly ſhaped, and much broader in ſome Parts, than the ſaid Orifice.</head>
                        <p>As for the firſt part of our Paradox, it is propoſed by <hi>Stevinus</hi> in more general Terms, and thus demonſtrated, (See Fig. 7. Plate the ſecond) where, ſuppoſing A B C D to be a ſolid Rectangular figure of Water, whoſe Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis E F is parallel to the Horizon, and whoſe
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:59609:747"/>height G E is a Perpendicular from the Surface of that Water, the bottom D E, E F, and F C cannot be charged with a greater weight than what is reſpectively Perpendicular, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe none of them can receive an Additional weight from the Water Collaterally, but it muſt diminiſh the weight of Water Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly incumbent on that other bottom, elſe there muſt be a greater weight upon the Baſis D E F C, than is contained in the Surface A B. C D, which is impoſſible.</p>
                        <p>To which inſtance of the learned <hi>Stevinus</hi> I ſhall add the following. For if Oyl be ſuck'd up into the Pipe repreſented by Fig. 8 Plate the ſecond, and when it is at a convenient height in the longer Leg, you nimbly ſtop the upper Orifice, till it be depreſſed ſo low into the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that the Oyl is but little above the Surface of the Water, it will reſt near that ſtation, when the upper Orifice is unſtopped; and if it be depreſſed lower than that, the weight of the incumbent Pillar of Water will force its way into the Pipe, ſo far as anſwers the weight of a Cylinder of Water of an equal Bore with the Oyl contained in the Pipe, and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if the Pipe be elevated above its firſt ſtation, as much Oyl will riſe out of the Pipe and emerge, as anſwers in weight to the part of the incumbent Pillar of Water removed by that means from gravitating upon it. And to this I ſhall add, that tho' Water is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Pipes, yet it preſſes as regularly upon ſubjacent Bodies as if it were; which will be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, if a Veſſel of the ſhape of the Funnel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineated in Fig. the 6th be imployed, for
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:59609:748"/>the Liquor contained in the ſmall Stem of that will be able to ſuſtain the whole incumbent Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: In confirmation of which, we made uſe of ſuch a Veſſel, as Plate the third, figure the firſt repreſents,<note place="margin">See Plate <hi>3.</hi> Fig. <hi>1.</hi>
                           </note> and filling the parallel Leg with Oyl, and the other as well as the Ball with Water, the Oyl was elevated no higher in the longer Leg, than if the leſs Leg had been an uniform Tube of the ſame Diameter; and when the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment was reiterated with Oyl in the Ball, and Water in the long Leg, the weight of that Oyl was not able to raiſe the Water in the long Leg to an equal ſuperficies with it ſelf; the Liquors in both theſe Experiments which was contained in the capacity of the Ball, being ſuſtained by the concave ſides of the Glaſs. And the like Experiment being tryed with Quick-ſilver, which was poured into the ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Leg C D, till it rought almoſt to the bottom of the Ball, and as high in the longer Tube A B, upon an affuſion of Water into the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Leg, the Mercury was buoyed up into the Ball, till it rought to H E G, where if more than what was Perpendicularly incumbent on the Tube C had preſſed upon it, the Water would not have been able to keep it at ſuch a height.</p>
                        <p>But to confirm the ſecond part of our Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,<note place="margin">See Plate <hi>3.</hi> Fig. <hi>2.</hi>
                           </note> we made uſe of a Glaſs, ſuch as Plate the third Fig. the ſecond repreſents, and having filled the Glaſs half full of Water, we ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped it with a Cork, in which the Pipes there delineated were fixed, and likewiſe the Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, the bottom of each of the Pipes, being each immerſed conſiderably in Water, and
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:59609:748"/>then pouring in Oyl through the Tunnel, we obſerved, that the Water was elevated to an equal height from the lower ſuperficies of the Oyl which preſſed on the Water; in which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, tho' the Pipes contained more Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by being included, yet that Water preſſed no more upon the imaginary Plain, than an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Pipe of equal Bore with the lower ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the Water contained in it would have done. And if Oyl of Turpentine be poiſed in a Pipe in an erect Poſture, and then by inclination a greater portion of it brought under Water, yet the external Water will raiſe the Oyl con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it; and the ſame was evident, when Oyl of Turpentine being contained in three Pipes of ſuch figures as Plate the third Fig. the third repreſents, for in all ſuch caſes,<note place="margin">See Fig. <hi>3.</hi> Plate <hi>3.</hi>
                           </note> where the Pipes are in an inclined Poſture, or ſome Parts of them larger than ordinary, part of the weight of the Liquors contained weigh upon the ſides of the Veſſel, and no more preſſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſubjacent Liquor, than is anſwerable to an erect Pipe of equal Bore with the lower Orifice, and of equal height with an erect Tube, anſwerable to the length of one end of that Pipe from the other.</p>
                        <p>To make out what <hi>Stevinus</hi> hath aſſerted, <hi>viz.</hi> That if a Cylinder of Water be placed upon a ſubjacent Body, the Baſis will ſuſtain a weight equal to that Circular Baſis, and to the Perpendicular height of it, we provided a Veſſel of Laton,<note place="margin">See Fig. <hi>4.</hi> Plate <hi>3.</hi>

<pb n="298" facs="tcp:59609:749"/>and greaſed on the lower ſide near the edges, that leaned on the rim of Wood G H, contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous every where to the inſide of the Latten, that it might be eaſily lifted up from off the rim, and yet at other times lye ſo cloſe upon it, that the Water ſhould not be able to get out between them. To the midſt of this bottom was faſtned a long ſtring, for a uſe to be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after mention'd; the Inſtrument being thus prepared, the Water was poured in at the top of the Pipe A B, which preſſing upon the falſe bottom C D, againſt the ſubjacent rim G H, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to render the Veſſel more cloſe, and to obſtruct its own paſſage, whereupon we tyed the upper end of the ſtring I K to a beam, and put ſo many weights into the oppoſite Scale, as were ſufficient to raiſe the falſe bottom C D from the rim G H. And then deducting from that weight, the weight of the falſe bottom, and the Water contained in the broad Cylindri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Box B E C H.

                           </note> that having ſtopped the Mouth of the Vial ABCD, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by Fig. ſix, Plate the third, with a Cork and Cement, and bored with a hot Iron, a hole to receive the Pipe G H, and the other E F, I ſtopped the Orifice G with a Cork and Cement likewiſe, and then pouring in Water through the Pipe E, till it roſe to the Surface I, the Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble X was ſo nicely poiſed that it ſwam, but as ſoon as by pouring in more Water the Surface was raiſed to K, the Bubble X ſubſided to the bottom: From whence it appears, that the whole Water contained in the Pipe E, preſſes

In which Experiment, if the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be asked, why the Water does not rather run out of the Bipe <hi>H,</hi> into <hi>G,</hi> than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary? It may be anſwered, That tho' exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the Oyl is deeper upon the ſurface of the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:59609:752"/>Water in the Pipe <hi>H,</hi> and conſequently preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes more upon it, yet the Tube <hi>G,</hi> on the other ſide, inſtead of having that preſſure of Oyl, hath a Cylinder of Water of an equal length, which being heavier than Oyl, raiſes the Water out of that Tube more forcibly than it is raiſed out of the other. And for the like Reaſon, when once the Water is raiſed in Syphons, tho' there be a longer Cylinder of Air upon that end which is immerſed in the lower Veſſel, yet there is a greater weight on the other, becauſe beſides the incumbent Atmoſphere, there is a conſiderable Weight of Water: But if the Syphon be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 34 or 35 Foot high the Water will not flow through it, the preſſure of the external Air being unable to raiſe Water to ſuch a height. And one thing obſervable in theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments is, That if when the Water is run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning through theſe Syphons, a ſmall hole be made upon the top of a Syphon, the Air preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon the Water within the Pipe as well as without it, it will ceaſe to run, tho' the hole be no bigger than one made with a Needle; which hole if it be ſtopped with a Needle, the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the external Air will by that means be taken off, and the Syphon be rendred fit for uſe.</p>

                        <p>The firſt Objection is, that if the upper Parts of the Water preſſed upon the lower, the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:59609:753"/>would be condenſed; but to this it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that Water conſiſting of Parts tho' minute, yet very ſolid, it does not therefore follow, ſince in a heap of the powder of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, the lower are no more compreſſed than the ſuperficial ones,; beſides it hath not been found that Water was capable of being compreſſed by any force we could uſe. And tho' it be further urged, that Plants grow in the Sea without being depreſſed, yet that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, becauſe the Preſſure is not only incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent but Collateral likewiſe, and ſo contributes to ſuſtain it, and the rather becauſe the Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Preſſure is greater than the incumbent.</p>
                        <p>Another Objection is, that a Bucket of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter weighs no more when full in Water than the Bucket it ſelf out of it, nor ſo much. But the Reaſon of this is very plain, for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing <hi>A B C D</hi> to be a Well, (See Plate the fourth,<note place="margin">See Plate <hi>4.</hi> Fig. <hi>5.</hi>
                           </note> Figure the fifth) in which the Bucket which is contiguous to the Plain <hi>I K,</hi> is ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the ſtring <hi>E F,</hi> the Water in the Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et <hi>G</hi> (if it be made of Wood which is lighter in Specie than Water) and the incumbent Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of Water not preſſing upon the Surface <hi>H</hi> equally as the Water on the Surface <hi>I K,</hi> the Water below muſt buoy it up. And tho' the Bucket was made of ſomething heavier than Water, yet the whole weight of it will not be perceived by the hand above, but only the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſage of weight which ſurmounts the weight of an equal bulk of Water. And tho' the School-men tell us, that this Phaenomenon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the indiſpoſition of Water to weigh in its own place, yet I have found, that Lead
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:59609:754"/>being convey'd into melted Butter contained in a wooden Box, and that being ſuſpended in Water by a Silken-thred at the end of a ballance, we obſerved that this was as much indiſpoſed to weigh as Water in Water, no more weight than what ſurmounted the weight of an equal bulk of Water, being made ſenſible by the ballance: But when it was partly raiſed out of the Water or wholly, a greater weight was requiſite to counterballance it; for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, that part of the Bucket <hi>N</hi> to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Surface of the Water <hi>L M,</hi> a great force is requiſite to ſuſtain it, the weight of Water incumbent on the Surface <hi>P Q</hi> being not able to ballance it, and conſequently the bottom of the Bucket <hi>H,</hi> will ſcarce be preſſed upwards half ſo ſtrongly as before.

                        <p>This Inſtrument may be made of any Metal or other matter, which will float in the Water, without ſoaking it in, but the beſt for the uſes hereafter mentioned are thoſe made of Glaſs; tho' they are not ſo laſting as thoſe that conſiſt of Copper or Silver.</p>
                        <p>This Inſtrument is made of three Parts, a Ball, the Stem, and that which holds the Pipe, The Ball conſiſts of two Metalline Plates, each of the faſhion of a Convex Glaſs; and the Cavity within muſt be ſo large, that the Air contained
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:59609:756"/>in it, may be ſufficient to hold as much Air as will keep the whole Stem from ſinking under Water; if the Ballaſt which is to keep the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel immerſed in an erect poſture is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd within the Veſſel, the Stem ought to be hollow, but otherwiſe to conſiſt of a ſmall Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder without any Cavity, and of a convenient length.</p>
                        <p>The Inſtrument I employ for Guineas hath its Ball as big as a Hens-egg, and the Stem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four or five Inches long, being ſoddered on to a hole in the Centre of the uppermoſt Convex part of the Ball; and to the Centre of the lowermoſt is fixed a piece of Wire to lay the Guiny upon, or a ſcrewed ſtirrup to fix it in.</p>
                        <p>If you have a mind to try pieces of Gold of greater weight, the ſtirrup ought to be fixed to a ſmall Cylinder, upon which ſeveral pieces of Metal being fixed, and having holes in the middle, that they may be put on or taken off as occaſion requires, the Inſtrument may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted to any piece of Gold, tho' twice or thrice as heavy as a Guiny.</p>
                        <p>To adjuſt this Inſtrument for the uſe of Guineas, it muſt be lightned by the uſe of a file, or made heavier by the addition of Ballaſt, that it may be ſufficiently immerſed in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without ſinking, and then a mark being fixed on the Stem at the Surface of the Water, a piece of Braſs muſt be ſubſtituted in the place of the Guiny of the ſame weight, or a grain or two heavier in the Air, and a mark ſet at the Surface of the Water, when it is immerſed by that weight.</p>

                        <p>In which method of adjuſting, the following Particulars are to be minded.</p>

                           <item>Firſt, the Guinea muſt be placed exactly with its middle in the ſcrew, that it may not incline the Tube, but let it ſtand erect.</item>
                           <item>Secondly, Quick-ſilver Ballaſt in Metalline Inſtruments is apt to diſſolve the ſodder.</item>
                           <item>Thirdly, the marks may be made of chewed Maſtick fixed in ſmall holes; or by fixing a Silver or a Golden Wire in a nick made round the Stem.</item>
                           <item>Fourthly, one of the heavyeſt Guineas is to be made uſe of in adjuſting this Inſtrument, and care muſt be taken that ½ of an Inch be left above the Water, becauſe all Waters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are not of an equal weight, yet thoſe circumſtances vary not the ſucceſs, ſince the difference in the immerging this Inſtrument in ſeveral Waters, is in conſiderable in reſpect of the difference betwixt a piece of Braſs and Gold of an equal weight in the Air, it being an Inch and three quarters.</item>
                           <item>Fifthly, before we can determine by this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument whether the Gold be good, it muſt be weighed in the Air, to ſee whether it be of a juſt weight, and then this will diſcover whether it be genuine, for otherwiſe we may think the Metal not good, when it only wants weight in the Air.</item>

                        <p>That ſeveral pieces of Gold may upon ſome occaſions be fix'd at once, the aperture of the ſcrew ought to be wider, than what will juſt admit of a Guinea.</p>

And the ſame Gentleman told me, that having cauſed the Water which waſhes the Earth away from the Ore, to lay down that Earth, by ſtopping the current of it, till its own weight made it ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, that Earth being twelve years expoſed to the Air, yielded a good quantity of Metal.

And tho' it be believed that the Reaſon why the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges into ſome Mines grow narrower, is to be attributed to the growth of the Metal, yet I am apt to believe, that it may be cauſed by the powerful expanſion of ſome frozen Water in the Earth, that encompaſſes thoſe paſſages; and whereas it is urged as an Argument of the growth of Metals, that Lead increaſes its weight by being expoſed to the Air on the tops of Churches, yet I am inclined to believe, that it rather proceeds from a <hi>Ceruſſe</hi> formed by corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Parts, uniting with the Parts of the corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Metal, and chiefly for this Reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe I have obſerved, that the Wood which lyes about that Lead abounds with an Acid Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, capable of corroding Lead, and that when they have been long expoſed to this Acid, a white Lead may be ſcraped off better than the common <hi>Ceruſſe,</hi> and this is found on that ſide the Lead which is next the Wood, and not on that expoſed to the outward Air.

                        <note place="margin">Ores Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droſtatical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſtimated.</note>TO help me to make an eſtimate of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Metalline or the Mineral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients of Bodies, I weighed a piece of Rock-Cryſtal or white Marble, firſt in Air and then in Water, by which I found that its weight, to an equal bulk of Water, was as 2 ¾ to 1, or as 11 to 4, and then by weighing Metalline Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, ſuch as Magnets and Emeri, I found that the weight of theſe in Water was more than that of Cryſtal, the proportion of the latter being as four to one; by which Tryals I was enabled to gueſs that theſe ſtones contain Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline Parts in them: And by the ſame method I diſcovered Metalline Ingredients in ſome Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:59609:761"/>which are not generally looked upon as ſuch, as <hi>Lapis Hematites,</hi> and <hi>American</hi> Talc.</p>
                     <p>And as it is generally a certain ſign, that a Body contains mineral ingredients proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably as it is heavier than Cryſtal, ſo it is no leſs certain, that Bodies lighter than Cryſtal are not impregnated with a Metalline Ore, as Jet, <hi>Succinum,</hi> Sulphur <hi>Vive,</hi> common Sulphur, <hi>Engliſh</hi> Talc, <hi>Venetian</hi> Talc, and black Lead, whoſe weight to Water is but as 1 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>/100 to 1, and which by certain Tryals I have found to be a kind of Talc.</p>
                     <p>As for the advantages that may be reaped by eſtimating Ores, they may either reſpect Jewellers, Phyſicians, or Chymiſts, as when the Metalline Ingrediens are but ſmall; or Mineraliſts, whoſe buſineſs it is to extract the Metal, when by this Hydroſtatical way it appears to be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently impregnated. But, becauſe there are ſome cruder Metalline Ingredients in ſome Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as <hi>Antimony, Biſmuth, Lapis, Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaris</hi> and <hi>Pyrites,</hi> which may deceive an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful Mineraliſt who eſtimates them this way, it may be convenient to make uſe of other Tryals to diſtinguiſh them. And ſince ſome mineral Ores, when tryed in the lump, appear to be poorly ſtocked with Metalline Parts, it may be of uſe to beat them to powder, and to ſeparate the Metalline Parts, by waſhing, or elſe by fire; for by that means I once found, that a Metalline Ore which was wrought for Lead, afforded a ſufficient quantity of Silver to anſwer the charge of working it, and to this caution I muſt add the following, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſince <hi>Marcaſites</hi> are generally heavier
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:59609:761"/>than common Cryſtal, and by ſome looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be plentifully ſtocked with Metalline Parts, becauſe of their weight, and the glittering of their Parts, yet they may eaſily be undeciv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by placing them in a hot fire, for by that means the Sulphureous Parts will be conſumed, and leave behind them a black Calx; but tho' <hi>Marcaſites</hi> abound not with Metalline Parts, proportionable to their bulk, yet I have found by experience, that ſome of them have afforded not only Copper, Silver, and Gold, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a quantity of running Mercury; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Marcaſites</hi> may be of uſe in graduating Gold, or not, I ſhall leave to others to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. There is this Advertiſement which I muſt not omit, and it is that tho' ſome are uſed to employ flux powders indiffently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out underſtanding the difference of them, I have tryed, that Lead Ore being fluxed with filings of <hi>Mars,</hi> afforded a larger quantity of Metal, than with a due proportion of Nitre and Tartar fulminated together; but one part of good native Cinnabar, finely powdered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mixed with a fix't <hi>Alkaly</hi> of Tartar, and the other with a different flux powder, we obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed twice as much Mercury from the former, as we did from the latter, tho' it was likewiſe a fixt <hi>Alkaly</hi> of a mineral Nature.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about native Gold.</note>Tho' I once believed, that there was no ſuch thing as a Gold Mine, in which that Metal was predominant, yet I had a Portion of Ore ſent me from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> with the ſpar about it, which
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:59609:762"/>had I broke it, I queſtion not but that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Parts which were malleable without the help of the fire: one piece of this had ſo much Spar about it, that it weighed to an equal bulk of Water, as 2 91/100 to 1. The colour of the Spar was like white Marble tinged with a daſh of yellow, and it differed from Lead Ore, in as much as that is uſually ſo ſoft as to be eaſily cut with a knife, but this was as hard as a ſtone, and would yield ſparks when ſtruck with a piece of Steel; and it differed further from Spar of Lead Ore, in as much as it was altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of being calcined, tho' kept in a Crucible red hot for ſome hours. Nor would it be diſſolved in Acid <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> as Spar of Lead Ore may. A piece of Spar in which but little Gold was contained, being weigh'd in Water, was to its proportion as 2 65/100 to 1, which is but little above the weight of common Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                     <p>But tho' there is ſuch a thing as true Gold Ore, yet I would not diſcourage <hi>Mineraliſts</hi> from ſeeking it in Veins of other Minerals, ſince it hath been found not only in Copper Mines, but veins of Tin and Lead; for in a place in <hi>Scotland</hi> ſeveral grains of native Gold have been found, near the Surface of the ground over Lead Mines, ſome pieces of which being weighed Hydroſtatically, one piece of <hi>Scotch</hi> Gold, which was native and free from adhering Spar, weighed three drachms twenty one grains, and another which had Spar ſticking to it, weighed three drachms three grains, and a third of <hi>Scotch</hi> Gold weighed in Air forty
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:59609:762"/>three grains, in Water thirty nine. Difference 3 × 1/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh pure Gold from impure, we are to note, that the Proportion of the fineſt, according to <hi>Merſennus,</hi> is as eighteen to one of Water, but according to ours, as nineteen to one. So that as it comes more or leſs ſhort of that Standard we are to eſtimate its Purity.</p>
                     <p>And thus by weighing Gold Hydroſtatically, we may be able to diſtinguiſh, that Sand-Gold which is brought from <hi>Africa,</hi> or that from <hi>Guinea,</hi> from adulterated; for having once weighed a ſmall Parcel of good, the Weight of that will be a Standard to diſtinguiſh the bad by.</p>
                     <p>But ſince a great many ignorant Sea-men are concern'd in buying Gold, who underſtand not how to examine it Hydroſtatically, I ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn the following method to diſtinguiſh it Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mically, <hi>viz.</hi> By mixing a few Grains with <hi>Aq. fortis,</hi> Spirit of fermented Urine, or Spirit of Harts-horn; for if it be adulterated with Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or Braſs, a few Grains laid upon Paper, and moiſtned with this, will be tinged bluiſh green. And even rank Urine will be able to extract a blue Tincture from Braſs, if made uſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the afore-mention'd Spirits; and the like ſucceſs will happen with <hi>Sal-Armoniack</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd in Water.</p>
                     <p>There are in <hi>England</hi> ſuch a great varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Stones, that it would be worth while to examine them Hydroſtatically, and to compare them with Cryſtal; for I have found near the high Road an Eagle-Stone, which was not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected to be of <hi>Engliſh</hi> growth. And I found a kind of <hi>Magneſia</hi> near a Potter's Work-houſe,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:59609:763"/>which he afterwards made uſe of to glaze his Pots. And I was brought to a Mineral Subſtance, which tho' it was hard to be known of what Kind it was, yet I ſoon diſcover'd it to abound with Vitriol, and that it would yield it much more plentifully than the Vitriol-Stones found near the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> or thoſe made uſe of at the Vitriol-Works near <hi>Deptford,</hi> and elſewhere. And Ore of <hi>Biſmuth</hi> hath been diſcover'd by a heedful Eye, when common Miners knew not what kind of Subſtance it was when they dug it up.</p>
                     <p>But this Hydroſtatical way of eſtimating Ores may not only be made of uſe in judging of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Subſtances, but thoſe Earths which are the Wombs of them; ſince, tho' they cannot be ſuſpended by a Hair, as ſolid Grains of Ore, yet a Jar may be counterpoiſed in Water, and then being filled with ſuch Earths, the weight of them may be diſcover'd, by firſt counterpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them in the Air, and then having firſt wetted them with Water, and convey'd them into the Water in that Hydroſtatical Bucket: And that this Hydroſtatical way of weighing Earths may be of uſe appears, ſince it hath not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been obſerv'd, that a red Mud, which lay at the bottom of Water, abounded with Iron plentifully, but I have obſerv'd the ſame in an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Oker. And I have been told, that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amonds, as well as Gold, have been found in a red kind of Soyl. And I have obſerv'd in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> curiouſly figur'd Cryſtals lodged in a Soyl of a red Colour.</p>
                     <pb n="327" facs="tcp:59609:763"/>
                     <p>And it may not only be of uſe to weigh di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſorts of Earths in our Bucket, but alſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts of Sands; ſince by a Microſcope, I have diſcern'd ſeveral Grains to appear, as if they were made of an Aggregate of Granates; and I have experienc'd, not only Hydroſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, that that black Sand which is made uſe of in <hi>London,</hi> contains good ſtore of Particles of a Martial Nature; but I have likewiſe been convinc'd by fluxing it, and by caſting it, whilſt it was melted, into the Conical Part of a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible. And I further obſerv'd, that ⅞ of it would be attracted by a powerful Load-Stone.</p>
                     <p>But a Mineral of a martial Nature hath not only been obſerv'd in Sand, but Gold on the Banks of <hi>Guiny,</hi> and on the Banks of <hi>Tagus</hi> which runs by <hi>Lisbon</hi> and <hi>Pactolus;</hi> and ſome hath been found on the Banks of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and a little River which runs down from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in <hi>Savoy.</hi> But much more Gold may be got from Sand Chymically, than by picking it up, if the Sand be reduced to Glaſs with Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharge or <hi>Minium,</hi> and then the volatil Gold be obtain'd by giving it a Body fit to retain and fix it; ſuch as Silver, out of which I have got by <hi>Quartation,</hi> out of as much vitrify'd Sand as filled a Retort, and two or three fluxing Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taments of ſmall price, ſixteen grains of pure Gold. And tho' by ſome it is thought ſtrange, that there ſhould be a neceſſity of fixing Gold, yet I have elſewhere made it appear, that by a ſmall addition of another Subſtance, Gold may be ſublimed without a naked Fire, and form ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Cryſtals like Rubies.</p>
                     <pb n="328" facs="tcp:59609:764"/>
                     <p>And if Sands, as well as Earths and Stones, abound with Mineral Ingredients, it may be convenient to take an account where ſuch Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are found, and likewiſe to take a Sample of them, as alſo of the Ores of different Mines, and to try them Hydroſtatically; for I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, that in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lead Ores of ſeveral kinds, thoſe in which thirty pound of Lead is only to be got out of an hundred of Ore, are looked upon as not worth working; thoſe that yield half their weight of Metal are indifferent; and other Ore which yields from fifty five to ſixty in the hundred is looked upon to be very good; but thoſe that afford eighty Pound in the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, are accounted very rich; but I have not met with any that afforded more than ſeventy five in a hundred weight: Which Ore ſeemed to conſiſt wholly of Metal, and was made up of Parts of a Cubical Figure, and much reſembling Dies placed one by another.</p>
                     <p>But beſides what hath been already propoſed, to be inquired after concerning Metalline Foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils, not only its Proportion is to be conſider'd, but the plenty or ſcarceneſs of the Mineral, the eaſineſs or difficulty of coming at it, as alſo its depth and freeneſs from Waters, its nearneſs to plenty of Fuel, its nearneſs to Water to drive Mills, and to tranſport it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are to be conſider'd likewiſe before one begins to work a Mine.</p>

                     <p>FROM what is contain'd in the fore-going Chapter, it appearing that white Marble or Cryſtal may be a Standard to diſtinguiſh mineral Subſtances from other Bodies, I ſhall here ſubjoin the way of weighing ſinking Bodies in Water.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The method of weighing Bodies.</note>And firſt, the ſolid Body to be examin'd, is to be ſuſpended by a Horſe-hair, at one of the Scales juſt now deſcribed, and there to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſed; then the Weights being taken out, by deducing from the weight of the Body in Air the weight of it in Water, by the Remainder
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:59609:765"/>divide the whole weight of the given Body in the Air, and the Quotient will ſhew the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ſpecifick Gravity, betwixt the examin'd Solid, and as much Water as is juſt equal to it in Bulk. For Example, if the Weight of a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick Inch of Rock-Cryſtal be 1169 grains in the Air, and 738 in Water, the Remainder will be 431 grains; by which the 1169 grains being divided, the Quotient will be found to be 2 × 71/100 or near enough 7/10, for the proportion of the Gravity of white Marbles to Water.</p>
                     <p>In which Direction it is requiſite to obſerve, firſt,<note place="margin">Cautions requiſite to be obſerv'd.</note> That what we have ſaid implys, that the Body weighed muſt be heavier than Water. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Horſe-Hairs are more convenient than other ſtrings, becauſe they are nearer to a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Gravity with Water. Thirdly, Where the Figure of a Body diſabled us from ſuſpending it by tying a hair about it, we platted a ſort of net of Hairs to hold it in. Fourthly, So much of the Hair as is above the Water muſt be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſed by a Weight in the other Scale. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Sometimes inſtead of the Scale I counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſed the oppoſite with a weight of Lead, and ſuſpended the Horſe-Hair at the String; but when I did not take off the Scale, I cauſed it to be perforated in the middle. Sixthly, Care muſt be taken that the Water below touches not the bottom of the Scale, and that the Body be freely ſuſpended, and wholly immerſed in the Water. Seventhly, Care muſt be taken, that no Bubbles of Air be contained in the Pores of the Body weighed, ſince the ſucceſs will be apt to fail in ſome Tryals upon that account.</p>
                     <pb n="331" facs="tcp:59609:765"/>
                     <p>And theſe circumſtances being obſerved, it will be eaſie to know, by the method propoſed, the difference betwixt the ſpecifick weight of other Bodies heavier than Water. It being agreeable to that Hydroſtatical Paradox of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> That a Body, heavier than Water, weighs leſs in Water than in the Air, by the weight of as much Water as is equal to it in Bulk or Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude. And,</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The firſt Uſe of this method of weighing Bodies.</note>By this Method we found, That the weight of <hi>Lapis Hematites</hi> to Water, was as four 15/100 to one, and by ſubliming it with <hi>Sal-Armoniack,</hi> we found by the Aſtringency of it, that it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded with Metalline Parts of a Martial Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; which was further confirmed, by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that a grain of it turned an Infuſion of Galls black <hi>Lapis Lazuli</hi> was to its bulk of Water in weight, as three to one. A Load-Stone, which beſides Magnetical, hath Medicinal Vertues, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be as four 93/100 to one. <hi>Lapis Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naris</hi> was as four 169/100 to one. In which Concretes, the Medicinal Virtues ſeem to depend on the plentiful mixture of metalline Ingredients; but ſome Bodies which abound leſs with Mineral Subſtances, may be as operative, by reaſon of ſome more active Particles. But,</p>
                     <p>This Hydroſtatical method of weighing Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>II</label> may be further ſerviceable in diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Stones from Plants, or other petrified Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as Coral, which weighs in proportion to Water, as two 68/100 to one, and therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be a Stone, being heavier than Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal. A monſtrous Pearl taken out of an Oyſter, which weighed 206 grains, was to Water as two 51/100 to one. A <hi>Calculus Humanus,</hi> which
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:59609:766"/>weighed ſix drams and a half, was in proportion to Water as one 76/100 to one; and another that weighed four drachms and a half, was to Water as one 69/100 to one. Theſe Stones, tho' the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of Diſtempers, have been accounted better than Oriental <hi>Bezoar</hi> in their Effects. Choice <hi>Bezoar</hi> Stones, which weighed three drachms in the Air, being weighed in Water, one of them was as one 47/100 to one; another ſomewhat lighter, was as one 53/100 to one; a third, which was taken out of another Stone, which being weighed in the Air weighed ſix drachms wanting nine grains, was in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Water as one 55/100 to one: So that theſe have a much leſs ſpecifick Gravity than Foſſil Stones.</p>
                     <p>A third uſe of this Hydroſtatical way of weighing Bodies,<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>III</label> may be to diſtinguiſh ſeveral Species of Bodies into ſubordinate Species, as the Load-ſtones of ſeveral Countries are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in weight; for I have obſerved <hi>Norwegian</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Load-ſtones, to be heavier in <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi> than thoſe that came out of <hi>Italy,</hi> in which the Iſland of <hi>Elba</hi> abounds with Mines, whereof one intire Maſs weighed a great many hundreds of Pounds.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly,<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>IV</label> This method may enable us to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh counterfeit Stones, from thoſe that are real and good, ſince when they are Hydroſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally weighed, there will appear a manifeſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, not only in adulterated Coral, but <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoar,</hi> and other valuable Stones.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly,<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>V</label> By this means we may be enabled to diſtinguiſh betwixt genuine Concretes uſed in Medicine, and thoſe that are not genuine; as
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:59609:766"/>alſo whether precious Stones abound more or leſs with Metalline Ingredients. But tho' ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Stones that are tranſparent may not be ſo plentifully impregnated with Medicinal and Mineral <hi>Effluvia,</hi> yet conſidering the Activity and great ſubtlety of ſome Pigments, the latter may be as powerful. And that every ſenſible part of a Body may be impregnated by a ſmall quantity of Pigment, will appear from the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Experiment, <hi>viz.</hi> If five grains of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phora</hi> be mixed with one ounce and half of <hi>Venice</hi> Glaſs finely powdered, and kept in fuſion in a furnace with a violent hot fire, it will give the whole a fine blue colour, and if the proportion of the <hi>Zaphora</hi> be as one to ſix, the Glaſs will be too deeply tinged to make a handſome Gem. And to ſhew further, that a ſmall quantity of Metalline matter may be ſufficient to impart a virtue to Glaſs and even Gems, I ſhall add, that eight grains of the powder of a <hi>German</hi> Granate, being kept in fuſion with an ounce of Cryſtalline Glaſs, it gave it a Tincture like that which Steel gives to pure Glaſs.</p>
                     <p>From what hath been ſaid it appears, how the proportion of ſolid ſubſtances to Water may be Hydroſtatically-diſtinguiſhed; but ſince there are other ſubſtances which cannot be ſo weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being either ſubject to diſſolve in Water, or not fit to be ſuſpended by a Hair, by reaſon of their form, being either powders or liquids, to make an eſtimate of theſe, I contrived the Bucket formerly mentioned, and repreſented in Fig. 00, Plate the firſt, which being ſuſpended in Water and counterpoiſed, we put a known weight of Quick-ſilver in it, by which means
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:59609:767"/>comparing its weight in Water with its weight in Air, and dividing the greater number by the difference of its weight in Air from what it was in Water, and which was thirty four grains, we found the Quotient to be fourteen and about 1/10, ſo that the Mercury made uſe of in this Tryal was as 14 11/100 to 1, but common Mercury which is ſold in the Shops we have found to weigh not above thirteen and a half to one, and indeed I have found a notable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity in the weight of moſt common Mercuries, eſpecially thoſe drawn from Gold; for the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury being combined with that Metal becomes heavier than common Mercury. By the ſame meaſure we may know the ſpecifick Gravity of any Liquors which are heavier than Water, and which are unapt to mix with it, ſuch as Oyl of Cinamon, Cloves, <hi>Guajacum,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And by the aſſiſtance of the ſame Bucket, we may be able likewiſe to weigh Powders, and eſtimate their goodneſs, if we put a known weight of them in the Air into the Bucket, and pour in gently as much Water as will fill up the Pores contained betwixt them, and be ſufficient to expel the Particles of Air contained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſmall Parts of it; but in all theſe Tryals it will be requiſite to ſuſpend the Scales of the Gibbet delineated in the preceding Figure, that the Scale may hang the ſteddier, whilſt the Body is a weighing.</p>
                     <p>But ſince there are ſeveral ſaline Bodies, as Sublimate, <hi>Mercurius dulcis,</hi> Vitriol, Rock-Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which cannot be weighed in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in ſuch caſes, inſtead of Water, we may ſubſtitute Oyl of Turpentine, which tho' it be
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:59609:767"/>of a different ſpecifick Gravity from Water, yet by carefully weighing a parcel of any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which is genuine in that Liquor, it may ſerve for a Standard to eſtimate the goodneſs of other parcels of the ſame ſubſtance by, and it will be no very difficult matter for one well skilled in numbers, by comparing the ſpecifick Gravity of Oyl of Turpentine and Water to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to know what proportion the Body weighed in Oyl, would bear to an equal bulk of common Water.</p>
                     <p>Another way which may be taken to eſtimate the ſpecifick Gravities of Liquors is, by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſe of a Body that will ſubſide in all Liquors but Quickſilver, for thus by firſt weighing that Body in Air, and then in ſeveral Liquors, and having noted the difference betwixt the ſolid and each of the Liquors, it is not difficult to find the ſpecifick weight of each, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions betwixt them. And ſince it is but one ſolid that is compared thus to the differing Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors; whatſoever their Number is, it will not be difficult to compare the ſpecifick Gravities of the Liquors betwixt themſelves, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover by the weight of the firſt, that of any other, which ever one pleaſes.</p>
                     <p>But in making choice of ſuch a ſolid Body, as may ſerve our preſent purpoſe, care muſt be taken, that it be ſuch as will not be ſubject to be conſumed by <hi>Effluvia;</hi> or too large for a tender Ballance; nor ſo big as to require too much Liquor to cover it; and laſtly, it ought to be of ſuch a Nature, that it may not be liable to be corroded by ſharp and corroſive Liquors, or eaſily broke, but ſuch as may be eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:59609:768"/>that what Experiments are tryed with it may eaſily be tryed by others, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to Poſterity.</p>
                     <p>The Bodies made uſe of in trying theſe kind of Experiments, and which came neareſt what we thought requiſite for ſuch Tryals was, when we examined common Water, Rain-Water, Spirit of Wine, Wine, Brandy, Vinegar, and the Liquors drawn from it, Cyder, Beer, Ale, Urine, Waters diſtilled from Vegetable and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal ſubſtances; Amber: But to eſtimate the weight of heavier Liquors, we employed a Glaſs-Bubble, Hermetically ſealed and filled with Mercury. But this being both hard to be obtained, and harder to be preſerved, I made uſe of the following Body in ſuch Experiments as are to be recorded for Poſterity, <hi>viz.</hi> A Globe of Rock-Cryſtal which was ſuſpended by a hair which paſſed through a ſmall hole in it, and which we employed to diſcover the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of thoſe Liquors, which we could obtain greater quantities of, but for others we employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Hexagonal Priſm, with a kind of Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid at the end, and this Body being of ſuch a Figure we were able to employ it in ſmall Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linders, in which a ſmall quantity of Liquor would ſurround it and cover it. The weight of the Ball of Cryſtal we employed was to its bulk of Water as 2 57/100 to 1, and the weight of the Priſm as 2 66/100 to 1.</p>
                     <p>And this method of weighing Amber in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Liquors, may not only acquaint us with their ſpecifick Gravities, but alſo from thence we may learn to know which are moſt Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:59609:768"/>For tho' a piece of Amber weighed but 6 ¾ grains in Water, yet in common red <hi>French</hi> Wine it weighed 8 ½, in <hi>Nants</hi> Brandy 17 ⅛, and in rectifyed Spirit of Wine 34 ⅛.</p>
                     <p>This Hydroſtatical method of eſtimating, may likewiſe contribute to diſcover the ſtrength of Acid Liquors, thoſe that are ſtrongeſt cauſing the ſolid to weigh leſs, as they are ſtronger, the greater decrement of weight proceeding from the greater proportion it contains of Salts that are not Volatile. It may likewiſe ſave the waſting of ſeveral Liquors, as Spirit of Wine or Brandy, in trying their goodneſs. And further it may be imployed in eſtimating the intenſive weight of Wine, Beer, Ale, Mead, Cyder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and diſtinguiſh their goodneſs, without conſuming them.</p>
                     <p>But Amber will not be heavy enough to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the ſtrength of Oyl of Tartar <hi>per deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quium,</hi> and ſuch heavy Bodies, ſince they are too heavy for it to ſubſide in.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, the afore-mentioned there may be another uſe made of our Hydroſtatical ſolid, <hi>viz.</hi> To ſhew when <hi>Menſtruums</hi> are of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient ſtrength. For that there is a peculiar degree of Spirituouſneſs requiſite in ſome Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents is evident, ſince if <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> be too ſtrong, it will not be able to diſſolve Silver, no more than if it be too weak, till it is diluted by an addition of Water; and it is much more fit to diſſolve filings of crude Lead, when more dilute: So rectifyed Spirit of Wine is not always the moſt proper <hi>Menſtruum</hi> for gummy Bodies, ſince it diſſolves only the pureſt Reſin, and leaves the Mucilaginous Parts behind, which
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:59609:769"/>may be as good in Medicine as the other, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſee that Gum <hi>Arabick</hi> and Tragacanth are not ſo eaſily diſſolved in good Spirit of Wine as in weak Liquors; and the like may be obſerved in diſſolving Myrrh.</p>
                     <p>To what hath been ſaid on this occaſion, there is one thing to be added, that when this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient is made uſe of in Oyl of Vitriol or Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar <hi>per deliquium,</hi> it is neceſſary to put ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing into the Scale to compenſate the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Horſe-hairs, ſince in ſuch Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the ſpecifick Gravity of the Liquors ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Gravity of the Hairs, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they will be apt to buoy up the Body immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and miſinform us in its true ſpecifick weight.</p>
                     <p>To the afore-mentioned ways of Hydroſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally eſtimating Liquors, we may add the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And firſt, it may be done by filling a Veſſel with a ſlender Stem ſucceſſively, with different Liquors, and weighing them, as alſo it may be done by a Braſs Cylinder, made heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at one end than the other, by which it may be made to float, and to ſwim deeper or higher above the Water, as the Liquor contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is heavier; or another way is by fitting too Bubbles together with Cement, by which their Stems being joined, and the one cauſed to ſink loweſt by a Ballaſt of Mercury, as the other is filled with a heavier or lighter Liquor, it will manifeſtly preponderate.</p>
                     <p>Another way propoſed by <hi>Merſennus,</hi> is by weighing a Glaſs and a Stopple in Water, and then filling the Bottle quite full, and putting in the Stopple; for the weight of the Glaſs and
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:59609:769"/>Stopple being deducted from the weight of the whole, the remaining weight will be the weight of the Liquor propoſed. But inſtead of this we made uſe of a round Glaſs-Ball with a Glaſs Stopple, which being firſt weighed in Air and Water, and counterpoiſed there, we were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſcover the weight of the Liquor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and its proportion to the bulk of the Liquor it was weighed in; and if the Bubble were too light to ſubſide in ſome heavy Liquors, we would bring it to a juſt weight by a Ballaſt of Mercury. But ſince ſuch Veſſels as theſe are very hard to be got, and ſome other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies attend it, we think it leſs ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry than thoſe other ways we made uſe of and propoſed before.</p>

<pb n="340" facs="tcp:59609:770"/>the other will be more uſeful which are tryed with Amber.</p>
                     <p>But to what hath been already delivered on this ſubject I ſhall add, that tho' in ſeveral Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als made with precious ſubſtances, a nice Ballance is requiſite, yet in moſt caſes the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Bodies is great enough to be diſcerned by a Ballance, not altogether ſo nice; for let the Ballance be never ſo nice, there is difference in the Textures and Compoſitions of Bodies of the ſame Denomination, for which, as well as in defect of a nice Ballance, allowances are eaſily made.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps it may be objected by ſome, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the method I have been propoſing, that ſince I generally weigh moſt Bodies in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it will be a hard matter to make them with any exactneſs, ſince it hath been obſerved, that moſt Waters themſelves differ in ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Gravity. But to this I ſhall briefly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that I have not perceived ſo conſiderable a difference as will fruſtrate theſe Experiments, in which we require not a Mathematical, but a Phyſical certainty.</p>

                     <p>IT being uſual for Phyſicians in the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſeveral Parts of the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> to ſignifie the ſize of Bodies by very indetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Terms, I thought that they might be aſſiſted by Hydroſtaticks, to give deſcriptions much more exact and ſatisfactory; and for that end having made two hollow Braſs Cubes, whoſe Cavities, being Cubical Inches, contained 256 grains, or a Cubical Inch of Water, it being a Law in Hydroſtaticks, that whatever Body is weighed in Water, it loſes ſo much of its weight, as an equal bulk of Water weighs, I concluded it would thence follow, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſolid was weighed in Water, if in that flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id it loſt 256 grains of its weight, it might be ſaid to be a Cubical Inch; and as it loſt more or leſs, ſo it might be ſaid to be of a Magnitude proportionable; for if it weighed but 128 grains leſs in Water, it might be ſaid, to be of ſuch a bulk of Water; but if it weighed 256 wanting thirty two grains, that being an eight of a whole Cubick Inch of Water, the bulk of the Body may be ſaid to be ⅞ of a Cubick Inch. And if the Body weighs one ounce thirty two grains (amounting to 512 grains) or one ounce and a half forty eight grains (amounting to 768 grains) the bulk of the Body will be equal to two or three Cubical Inches. And if
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:59609:771"/>after the Diviſion there remains a Fraction, it will not be difficult to eſtimate it, and to know the exact bulk of the Body, ſince the Cubical Inch conſiſts of ſuch <hi>aliquot</hi> Parts, as are eaſily and regularly divided and ſubdivided.</p>
                     <p>And thus we may eaſily know the bulk of a Body that is heavier than Water, but if it be ſpecifically lighter it will be a difficult matter. The method <hi>Merſennus</hi> propoſes is this, <hi>viz.</hi>

                           <item>Firſt, weigh the Body to be examined in the Air.</item>
                           <item>Secondly, take a piece of Lead of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate weight, and able to ſink the other Body in Water.</item>
                           <item>Thirdly, weigh the Plate in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the weight it loſes in Water, will be the weight of Water equal in bulk to the Body weighed.</item>
                           <item>Fourthly, tye together the Plate of Lead and the lighter Body, and note the weight of the Aggregate.</item>
                           <item>Fifthly, weigh the Aggregate in Water, and ſubſtract the weight of it there, from its weight in the Air, and the difference will be the ſpecifick weight of the ſaid Body in Water.</item>
                           <item>Sixthly, from this difference, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract the formerly found ſpecifick Gravity of the Plate alone in Water, and the remains will give you the weight of the lighter Body in the ſame Liquor.</item>
                        </list> And then dividing the obtained weight of the light Body in Water by 256 grains, and it will give you the ſolid content of that naturally floating Body. To illuſtrate this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, I ſhall ſubjoin the following Experiment.</p>

                     <p>The ſame method that hath been taken with ſolids not ſubject to diſſolve in Water, may be taken with Alloms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which is only by employing Oyl of Turpentine inſtead of Water; for a Cubical Inch of that weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 221 grains and ⅛, the difference of the weight of a ſolid in the Air, and in that Oyl, being divided by that Number, the Quotient will give you the ſolid contents of the Examined Body.</p>
                     <p>But to diſcover the weight of Bodies, which are apt to imbibe too much of the Liquor they are weighed in, we may guard them from it by a thin coat of Bees-Wax, and having firſt
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:59609:772"/>taken the weight of the Wax in Air, and then faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it to a Plate of Lead, ſubſtract the weight of as much Water as is equal in bulk to the Wax, and proceed with the Body contained, and the Plate of Lead as before taught; and having thus obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Weight of the propoſed Body in Water, by dividing it by 256 grains, by the help of the Quotient we may obtain the ſolid contents of the propoſed Body. Another way I deviſed for to learn the ſolid contents of a Body, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out imbibing Water into it, was, by finding the weight of a Cubick Inch of Mercury, and alſo the ſpecifick weight of the Veſſel, and then pouring upon the Body contained in that Veſſel as much Silver as it would hold, by knowing the weight of that Quick-ſilver from the weight of the whole which the Veſſel would contain, one might be acquainted, to how much Mercury the matter contained was equal.</p>
                     <p>Having thus propoſed a Hydroſtatical way of trying Bodies, I ſhall leave it to others to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive an Inſtrument more apt for ſuch uſes than I have done: And ſhall to what I have ſaid add, that theſe kind of Experiments do not always equally anſwer in ſucceſs, being apt to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſifyed, as well by the want of uniformity in the Qualities, and ſpecifick weight of Bodies of the ſame Denomination, as by the difference in Water in intenſely Hot and Cold Weather; as alſo upon the account of leſs exact Ballances. But another reaſon is the difference of weights of the ſame Denomination, for we are told by a diligent Mathematician, that, <hi>cum omnia grana, vel ſemina, quae reperiri ſolent in atriis venalibus Lutetiae, and ſtateram expendiſſet, vix granum
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:59609:772"/>ullum, inter ejuſdem Speciei grana grano alteri ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acte reſpondiſſet, in incertis Ludere noluit.</hi> And the ſame Author tells us, that 688 <hi>Roman</hi> grains are but equal to 576 <hi>French</hi> grains, and this eſtimate of their difference by another Ballance was found to be thirty ſix grains falſe: And the ſame Author receiving two accounts of the number of grains contained in a <hi>Roman</hi> ounce, the one told him there were 612, the other 576. And tho' our weights as well as thoſe made uſe of by <hi>Gheraldus,</hi> have twenty four ſcruples in an ounce, yet he divided his ſcruples into twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four grains, whereas we divide ours but into twenty. And <hi>Merſennus,</hi> p. 37. lib. 16. tells us, that <hi>cum autem dixi Chelinum, undecim dici denariorum, credunt tamen alii decem duntaxat, nil aſſero.</hi> And.</p>
                     <p>To what hath been ſaid, I ſhall only add, that tho' this method of weighing Bodies be not Mathematically exact, yet it comes as near Phyſical exactneſs as we can expect, and may be of uſe till ſome more nice way of Tryals be found out.</p>

<pb n="352" facs="tcp:59609:776"/>briskly; and ſome ſeeds being thrown upon it, they formed a ſort of ſcum; part of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing removed, and the Liquor placed in a warm Laboratory, I obſerved the following Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. The ſcum which remained on it being broke, part would be carryed to the left hand, and part to the right, by the motion of the Liquor.</item>
                        <item>2. When it came from under the ſcum, it moved very briskly, as if its motion upwards had been checked by it.</item>
                        <item>3. The Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor conſiſting partly of Oyl, and partly of Bituminous Ingredients, their motion might not only be the better diſcerned, but ſome of thoſe Oyly Parts riſing up to the top of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor would diffuſe themſelves orbicularly, and form a great <hi>Halo</hi> adorned with the vivid co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of a Rain-Bow, and theſe would continue till they loſt themſelves ſucceſſively under the ſcum.</item>
                        <item>4. The motions of this Liquor were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Vortical, which appeared by the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome Parts of the ſcum. And the Liquor all this while was actually Cold.</item>
                        <item>5. Some of this Liquor being poured into a Cylindrical Glaſs, it moved not as before, but being poured into a ſhallow wide-mouth'd Glaſs, it moved more briskly and variouſly than before in the Earthen Veſſel.</item>
                        <item>6. It moves more briskly or ſlow as the Weather varies in temper, and in all hath continued its motion ten days; and it continued this motion when poured out of a Vial into a convenient Glaſs ſeven or eight weeks after, but very languidly, and ſoon began to ſlacken its motion in point of ſwiftneſs; and from the firſt to the laſt time this Liquor was obſerved to move, it was about five Months.</item>

                        <p>A tall well ſet Gentleman about twenty four years old, having by a fall broke his Skull in ſeveral places, which were ſeveral times Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paned, and large Chaſms made in it by the taking away of ſeveral pieces, in about three days time he was ſeized with a Palſey on one ſide, ſo violently as to be deprived of motion and almoſt of ſenſe, except that in his Leg he had ſome ſhort remiſſions. And this Palſie continued about twenty four weeks, about which time his head being further laid open, they found a Splinter of a bone much like the ſcale of a Fiſh, which ſtuck ſo faſt and cloſe to the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> that an effuſion of Blood accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed the taking of it away, but that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtopped in about three days time his Palſie began to leave him, and he is now very ſtrong and healthy, tho' the Callus which ſupplies the place of his Skull be very large. From whence it appears, what great effects may ſpring from a very ſlight cauſe. But, beſides the aforementioned Obſervations, it was further to be taken notice of, that the Parts whilſt the Palſie continued were not only deprived of ſenſe and motion, but were very much extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by a continued Atrophy, which loſs of ſubſtance they acquired again upon a Ceſſation of the Paralytick affection. And it was further to be obſerved, that all the difference betwixt thoſe and other Parts was, that they were more ſubject to be cold. To which we may add, that tho' he was frequently let blood,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:59609:778"/>he continued to have a good ſtomach; nor did the affection of the Brain cauſe the leaſt Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, or Convulſions.</p>

                        <p>To ſhew the great and terrible effects of ſudden Paſſions of the mind, I ſhall relate the following. Hiſtory, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Woman having taken a Boy to a River ſide with her, which ſhe loved very well, the Boy accidentally falling into the Water unſeen by her, when ſhe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him ſhe was taken with a dead Palſie, which could not be removed.</p>

                        <p>But to ſhew what contrary effects violent Paſſions of the mind may have, I ſhall add, that a Gentleman who was in his youth taken with ſo violent a <hi>Sciatica,</hi> that he could not go, but was carried to Church, and look't up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as Incurable; yet once, when he was in the Church, news being brought that the enemy was entred into the Town, (which was a Frontier Garriſon,) and deſigned to Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre all in the Church, they all fled and left him behind them, who being as much afraid of himſelf as the reſt, got off his ſeat, and walk'd along like other Men, and this I received from the Perſon affected forty years after the ſaid fright, who in all that time ſuffered not the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe of the Diſtemper.</p>
                        <p>It might be of no ſmall advantage to Phyſick, would Philoſophers, amongſt thoſe Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

                        <p>Though Vomitive Medicines are not a little dangerous, yet ſince in ſeveral Diſeaſes they are altogether requiſite, I ſhall here lay down a Preparation which is as effectual, and yet ſafer than any other Liquor, and much to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before an Infuſion of <hi>Crocus Metallorum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Preparation is this, Diſtill two parts of Antimony, and three of Spirit of Wine, in a Glaſs-Receiver, 'till the diſtill'd <hi>Menſtruum</hi> is ſucceeded with red <hi>Flores,</hi> and filtrating the Liquor through Cap-Paper, lay it up for uſe cloſe ſtoped. It may be given from four to eight or ten Drops, in a ſpoonful or two of Wine, Black-Cherry Water, or Spring-Water, drinking ſome of the ſame Liquor after it, to waſh it down; it works very ſoon, and evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates plentifully and effectually without danger. It hath had not only very good ſucceſs in Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits and ſeveral other Caſes, but cured a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of an intermitting Feaver, which put on va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Types, and continued to afflict the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent three Years, notwithſtanding great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Jeſuit's Powder had been frequently
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:59609:779"/>given. But here it is requiſite to add this ſhort Advertiſement, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Powder, if kept long, being apt to precipitate, it muſt either be made uſe of whilſt the Liquor is freſh, or the Bottle muſt be ſhaked well when it is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A deſigned Chymical Medicine.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Conſidering the great eſteem and value of Mineral Waters, I contrived a way to imitate them, by making uſe of Ingredients, very harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in themſelves, and likely to make no leſs innocent a Compoſition.</p>
                        <p>The Tryal was this, Having digeſted in a Bolt-head, two days, one part of Filings of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, with ten of diſtill'd Vinegar, and then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the Heat 'till the tranſparent Liquor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to be of an Orange Colour, we poured part of it off, leſt the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> being too much impregnated, the Metal ſhould be preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated. This Orange-Colour Tincture being kept for uſe, we dropped four Drops into eight Ounces and a half of common Water, which made an artificial Spaw, whoſe Taſte not only agrees with that of the Natural Spaws, but it will, like <hi>Tunbridge</hi> or the <hi>German</hi> Spaw, turn a Tincture of Gauls Purple.</p>

                     <div type="experiment">

                        <p>The <hi>Bezoar</hi> Stone being a Medicine of great uſe, not only in malignant Feavers, but the Plague; and by reaſon of its dearneſs apt to be counterfeited, I ſhall add the following way of
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:59609:780"/>diſtinguiſhing betwixt good and bad, <hi>viz.</hi> by diſgeſting about fifty grains finely powdered, with ſix drachms of Spirit of Nitre, in a digeſtive Furnace; for after they have been mixed ſome time, the Spirit begins to diſſolve the Powder, and extracts a red Tincture; which being pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in a North-ward Window about eight and forty Hours, ſhoots into Chryſtals, much like thoſe of Salt-Petre.</p>
                        <p>To ſhew that the purging or aſtringent Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of Bodies, depend on the Diſpoſition of the Patient as well as of the Agent, I ſhall inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, that a certain Lady having eat a Toaſt with Cinnamon upon it, was ſo violently pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for about two days, that it brought Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions and a <hi>Spaſmus Cinycus</hi> upon her, which was not removed in three Years.</p>
                        <p>A Phyſician, to whom I communicated ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things, ſent me the following Account in a Letter from <hi>Dublin,</hi> dated <hi>Feb.</hi> 27. 1682. <hi>viz.</hi> That he found the good Effects of <hi>Ens Veneris</hi> in removing the <hi>Subſultus Tendinum,</hi> in a <hi>Febris Petechialis,</hi> which was fatal to many for about fourteen Months.</p>
                        <p>The Method I took in this Feaver was, if the Patient was coſtive, firſt to preſcribe a Gliſter, and a large bliſtering Plaſter between the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, keeping it running 'till the Declenſion of the Diſtemper; all this time I preſcribed Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of <hi>Aqua Aronis, Card. Bened. Citri, totius &amp; Syr. Gratorum cum Aceto,</hi> Orange and Butter-milk Poſſet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I avoid the uſe of all thoſe things that quicken the Circulation of the Blood; and I rather preſcribe Bliſtering to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, than cure Affections of the <hi>Genus Nervo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum,</hi>
                           <pb n="361" facs="tcp:59609:780"/>becauſe the Matter being once fixed in thoſe Parts, they become ineffectual.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Conſidering that the <hi>Menſtruums</hi> uſually em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in opening, and preparing the Body of Steel were Acids, I tryed to do it in the following me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. Having diſſolved freſh filings of Steel in a warm place, in a ſufficient quantity of Spirit of fermented Urine highly rectifyed <hi>per ſe,</hi> the filtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſolution had a taſte different from all other Chalybeat preparations, and being ſet in a cold Window, in three days precipitated a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of a green colour, yet the decantated Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor by Evaporation would not in the leaſt Criſtalize. This Preparation hath effects quite different from thoſe Preparations made by Acids, and is much more agreeable to ſome Perſons.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>That I might try whether a Metalline Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur might be obtained from Steel, I pitched upon a <hi>Menſtruum</hi> void of Sulphur, that if the Preparation ſhould yeild Sulphur, it might not be ſuſpected to come from the <hi>Menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi> Wherefore I diſſolved Steel in Spirit of Sea-ſalt, and upon Evaporation obtained very curious Criſtals, from which we drew by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation in a Retort, a good quantity of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, which came over in the form of Steams, which had a very Sulphureous ſmell, which being rectifyed and mixed with <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi>
                           <pb n="362" facs="tcp:59609:781"/>would diſſolve Gold, and give it the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Silver; which may intimate to us, how much the Vitriols of Metals may differ according to the difference of the <hi>Menſtruums</hi> which diſſolve them, ſince our green Vitriol affords Liquors different from that made with Oyl of Vitriol. Beſides which, it may be worth while to note, that though neither common or <hi>Roman</hi> Vitriol will diſſolve in Spirit of Wine, which is Inflamable, yet our Vitriol would readily, and here it will not be unneceſſary to hint by the by, that a ſolution of our ſaline Vitriol may not improbably be of uſe in Wounds, being a very powerful Aſtringent, and fit to prevent the breeding of Worms in Wounds, diſpoſed to abound with ſuch in cold Climates.</p>
                        <p>But what we cheifly deſigned in this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, and what is moſt to be taken notice of is, that the dry ſubſtance, raiſed by the fire, was diſtinguiſhed by accidents into three kinds of ſubſtances. Firſt, a Powder which when ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Air turned yellow. Secondly, a deep coloured ſubſtance betwixt red and brown, of Parts much groſſer than the former. Thirdly, a ſubſtance of a ſhining red, whoſe Parts were very fine and ſubtle.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> was changed into a Talky ſubſtance, conſiſting of <hi>Lamelloe,</hi> ſituated and connected much after the ſame manner, as the thick Plates which make up <hi>Muſcovia</hi> Glaſs.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about Diamonds.</note>DIamonds being not only the moſt Noble but Valuable amongſt Gems, it may be worth our while to conſider them a little, and to relate what Obſervations I have been able to make about them. And,</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>I. It is obſerved, that Diamonds are ſo much harder than other Bodies, that they require a greater force to cut and poliſh them than other Gems.</item>
                        <item>II. It is obſerved by one who hath long dealt in Diamonds, that thoſe which are now brought over are much ſofter than thoſe of the old Rock.</item>
                        <item>III. The Tradition is falſe, that Diamonds cannot be cut without being ſoftened in Goats Blood, the contrary being found by Diamond
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:59609:789"/>cutters, and an Experienced Diamond-cutter hath informed me, that he uſes to poliſh Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds with the duſt which he obtains by pound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of boared Diamonds in an Iron Mortar.</item>
                        <item>IV. Tho' it be a general received Opinion, that Diamonds have a weight proportionable to their Solidity, yet I find amongſt my Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that a Diamond being weighed Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatically in Wattr was to its proportion of that Liquor as 2 22/23 to 1, ſo that it did not equal its treeble proportion of Water in weight.</item>
                        <item>V. I am informed that if Diamonds be Cloudy, ſometimes one as big again as a Pea, will be at leaſt four grains heavier than another of an equal ſize.</item>
                        <item>VI. The natural ſhape of Diamonds is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, ſince moſt of them which we ſee are only broken pieces, whoſe figures are very irregular, yet I have ſeen ſome which ſeemed to conſiſt of Triangles terminating in ſolid Angles, and I am told by one who cuts a great number, that thoſe which are of a regular Figure are uſually four corner'd.</item>
                        <item>VII. It is obſerved, that in Diamonds there is a regular tendency of Fibers or thin Plates, which lye parallel to each other, which may be called the grain of them which way they may eaſily be divided, tho' not againſt that grain without difficulty.</item>
                        <item>VIII. As to the colour of Diamonds, tho' it generally be ſo well known, as not to need to be deſcribed, yet in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> ſome have been obſerved to be of a pale blue colour: And Monſieur <hi>Tavernier</hi> ſays, he hath ſeen
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:59609:789"/>one of a very red colour, and a Relation of mine wore a Diamond in a Ring which was of a Golden yellow; beſides which varieties of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, I have obſerv'd one amongſt a great many in the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Houſe whoſe colour was green.</item>
                        <item>IX. And I have ſeen a Diamond brought from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> which had ſix Triangular ſides and a Cavity in one of them, in which Diamond the Fibers might eaſily be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. And the Merchant to which this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, told me he had ſeen one brought from <hi>Borneo,</hi> which before it was Poliſhed was black, tho' after it appeared to be a clear Stone.</item>
                        <item>X. To conclude this Chapter, I ſhall add the following Relation, which will contenance what I have elſewhere related, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Virtue of Gems may probably ariſe from Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Tinctures incorporated with the matter of them, whilſt it was ſoft and fluid; the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is, that having applyed a Load-ſtone to a ſmall Diamond which was pretty dull, it would not only be taken up by it, but would at a conſiderable diſtance leap up to it. To theſe Obſervations I ſhall only add, that there are ſeveral other Obſervations which are ſcattered up and down my Writings, which I ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat here, they properly enough belonging to thoſe writings.</item>

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Gems.</note>THO' I am far from believing, that Gems are endowed with ſo many Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal Virtues as are uſually aſcribed to them; yet I believe they may have conſiderable Effects on Humane Bodies, which Virtues they may receive from the Intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Mineral and Metalline Parts, whilſt they were in a fluid form. And that preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Stones have once been in a fluid form, may be argued hence, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        <list>
                           <item>Firſt, from their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aphaneity;
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:59609:790"/>fluid Bodies being more apt to have their Parts ranged in an order requiſite to tranſparency, than ſolid Bodies; as Silver diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> and Lead in Spirit of Vinegar, not only become tranſparent, but may form Diaphanous Cryſtals.</item>
                           <item>Secondly, from their External figure; it being uſual for Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to form more regularly and curiouſly ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Cryſtals when in a fluid, than a ſolid Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient ſubſtance; for which Reaſon, if a Glaſs-Bottle be filled with a Solution of Nitre, and the Water hath been pretty well conſumed by boiling, the Salt will ſhoot into a Maſs, whoſe ſide next the Glaſs anſwers the form of it, but that next the Water will be ſet with Priſmatical Cryſtals of a Nitrous figure: And I have ſeen <hi>Indian</hi> Granates taken out of a lump of Heterogeneous matter, ſome of whoſe Surfaces were Triangles, others Paralellograms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording the figures of the Cells they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in.</item>
                        </list> And I have ſeen not only <hi>Briſtol</hi> Stones, but Corniſh Diamonds curiouſly ſhaped like Cryſtals of ſalt Petre: And I have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſeen Rubies very Geometrically ſhaped; and amongſt other Rarities, a Diamond whoſe Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face conſiſted of ſeveral Triangular Planes, which contained ſeveral leſſer within them, which for the moſt part met at a Point, and formed an obtuſe ſolid Angle. And I have obſerved, that moſt Diamonds have angular and determinate ſhapes.</p>
                     <p>And in favour of the Hypotheſis already laid down, I ſhall add, that precious Stones be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſſolved in a Particular <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> they ſhoot into Cryſtals like thoſe of Nitre, but
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:59609:791"/>inſipid. And I have obſerved, that tho' <hi>Briſtol</hi> Stones have on the upper part, ſix ſmooth ſides which were ſo cut as to repreſent ſix ſmooth Triangles, which terminate like thoſe of a Pyramid in a Virtex, yet the lower Part which was next the matter it adhered to, made it appear leſs tranſparent, and conformable in figure to the Cavity of its womb, this is more remarkably evident, when cluſters of theſe Cryſtals grow out of one Mineral lump. And to this I ſhall further add, that I have ſeen a Maſs which conſiſted of two flat Parallel Cakes, which ſeemed to be compoſed of a dirty kind of Cryſtalline ſubſtance; and out of each Cake there grew towards the other a great number of Stones, which having a little ſpace about them, were regularly ſhaped, and of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of a <hi>German</hi> Amethyſt. And I have a Stone which conſiſts of four Parts, the loweſt being like a flake of coarſe Stone, only adorned here and there with very minute glittering Particles, as if of a Metalline Nature; over this is ſpread a thin white Opacous bed, and the third is made up of a long ſeries of Cryſtals thick ſet, and which look whitiſh; and upon theſe which are not much thicker than a Barly-Corn, lyes another made up of Cryſtals like Amethyſts, ſome higher tinged than others, and more elevated where they had moſt Room to ſhoot; thoſe that were moſt elevated being hard e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to grate lines upon Glaſs. And I have found in the Cavities of concreted Stones Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals which were ſet round the ſides of them, and ſeemed to be formed of a Lapideſcent Juice, which was Percolated through the ſubſtance of
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:59609:791"/>the Stones, and formed curiouſly ſhaped Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals. And I am told by a digger, that he hath obſerved ſeveral cluſters of theſe Cryſtals which ſtuck to no part of the Rock, but ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be haſtily formed in a ſoft Mould.</p>
                     <p>But thirdly, not only the External but their Internal Texture favours our Hypotheſis; ſince it ſeems to imitate that of thoſe Bodies which have been formerly fluids: For it hath been obſerved, that ſeveral Particles of Salt ſticking together have not only formed large lumps, but <hi>Sal-Gem</hi> and lumps of the Iſle of <hi>Mayow</hi> Salt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broke ſeemed to be made up of the like Parts. And tho a ſolution of Silver uſually ſhoots into thin Plates, yet it may be ſo orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that ſeveral of theſe joining together may form larger Cryſtals, whoſe outſides may be finely ſhaped like ſome peculiar kind of Vitriol. And tho' tranſparent Bodies are uſually thought to be of an uniform Texture, yet I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that a thin <hi>Muſcovy</hi> Glaſs Plate, which was ſo thin as to be ſcarce viſible, might be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther divided into Plates; and the like hath been obſerved in other Stones; and to this I ſhall add, that I have been able to perceive the grain of a large <hi>Grizolette</hi> with my Eye, as well as in Hyacinths and Saphirs; and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates when they are broke, appear mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly to be made up of flakes or Plates; and ſo do even Diamonds themſelves, which are obſerved to cleave much more eaſily with the grain than againſt it, as Wood is obſerved to do, which is made up of an aſſimilated Juice which was firſt fluid: But it is obſerved in ſome Diamonds, that the flakes are not wholly
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:59609:792"/>Parallel, but in the ſubſtance of the Stone, ſometimes make Angles; for which reaſon ſome of them break in pieces before they will cleave through.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, it ſeems requiſite, that theſe Stones ſhould have been in <hi>ſolutis Principiis,</hi> that they might be tinged with Mineral Juices. Which propoſition ſuggeſts ſeveral Obſervations; and Firſt, That moſt Gems loſe their colour, or have it altered by the fire, and tho' it may be ſuggeſted, that the loſs of a colour may be effected without the addition of a Pigment, by a change of the ſuperficial Texture of a Body; (as when red Ink is beaten into a froth, or when Cryſtal receives ſeveral flaws in its Surface, by being ſuddenly cooled in Water, and becomes white, or in Cochinele, and puts on a pleaſing colour, by the inſinuation of the Tincture into the cracks and flaws) yet <hi>Indian</hi> Granates are obſerved to change their rediſh for a dark and dirty Iron colour, and Agats being kept a competent time in the fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came white, except where Mineral Veins ran, where it was obſerved, that the colour was not deſtroyed but changed, and became a deep red, tho' I ſuſpected that a more laſting fire would have turned them white, and the like change of colour hath been obſerved in Pebbles, and other Stones, ſome of which loſing their Tranſparency by Ignition, acquired a deeper colour upon their Extinction in Water. And to countenance what I have laid down, it may be further offered, that Gems are generally found near Mines, or Mineral Veins; and tho' they are not ſufficiently skilled in digging
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:59609:792"/>Mines to diſcover what they otherwiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably might, yet I have ſeen ſeveral Amethyſts which were taken out of Ground abounding with Iron and Tin Ores; and thoſe ſofter Gems called by Mineraliſts <hi>Fluores,</hi> are often to be found in or near Metalline Veins, finely tinged with Mineral Juices, which were they in hot Countries and ſufficiently hardened with the Sun, they might paſs for Emaralds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And I remember, that I once prepared a <hi>Menſtruum</hi> no more corroſive than white Wine, which being poured upon well coloured Granates ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted a lovely Tincture from them. And <hi>Benvenuto Cellini</hi> tells us, that he ſaw a Rubie which was not of the uſual colour but white, as alſo he acquaints us, that he hath ſeen Berils, Topazes, and Amethyſts of the ſame colour; and Rubies and Saphirs have been obſerved to be of the ſame degree of hardneſs, ſo that they were looked upon to be the ſame kind of Stone tho' differently tinged; and that the ſame kind of Stone may be differently tinged appears, ſince Diamonds have been obſerved to be yellowiſh, more yellow and perfectly yellow, bluiſh, greeniſh, and ſome as green as Emaralds. And one who lived near the River <hi>Siam</hi> or <hi>Pegu</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> told me, he had ſeen Stones taken out of the Water partly void of colour, and partly of the colour of a Rubie. And beſides what I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Agats and Opacous Gems, as to the differing colours of the ſame Stone; I wear a Sardoinx in a Ring, the uppermoſt part of which is black, the middlemoſt of a Cheſnut, and the other of a blue colour, almoſt like
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:59609:793"/>a Turquois, and each of theſe of an uniform breadth and Parallel to each other, and even amongſt Saphirs tho' they are commonly azure, yet a white Stone hath been called by the ſame name, becauſe of the ſame degree of hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And to theſe I ſhall add, that in <hi>Italy</hi> I have ſeen a large piece of Cryſtal, whoſe Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramidal part was of a trnſparent green; the Vertex being richly tinged like an Emerald; but the further the colour ſpread from the Vertex, the more dilute and pale it grew, ſo that the Baſe was tranſparent and like ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Cryſtal; agreeable to which <hi>Joſephus Acoſta</hi> ſays, that Emeralds ſeem to grow in Stones like Cryſtals, and <hi>by little and little to thicken and refine.</hi> He likewiſe ſays, he hath <hi>ſeen ſome half white and half green; others all white, and ſome green and very perfect.</hi> And I have ſeen a Saphir ſo odly tinged with Mineral fumes, that it might well be taken for a <hi>Chalcedonian,</hi> tho' of the hardneſs of a Saphir.</p>
                     <p>And to ſhew further, that ſolid Gems may include Heterogeneous matter in them; I ſhall add, that not only I but others have perceived ſomething in the Body of Rock-Cryſtal, which by varying the poſture of that Stone might be rendered viſible; and the like hath been ſeen in Griſolets brought from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies:</hi> And in a hard Stone brought from thence, and deſignedly broke, I found ſeveral clear and tranſparent Cryſtals, which had their Points in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and were Arguments that they had ſwam in ſome Liquors, whoſe incoagulable Parts were either imbibed by the Ambient matter or penetrated it. And to illuſtrate
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:59609:793"/>what I have ſaid I ſhall add, that I have not only ſeen a Fly in ſhape and ſize much like a Graſs-hopper, encloſed in ſolid Amber, but variouſly and curiouſly coloured with his wings diſplayed. And I have ſeen white Amethiſts in which there appeared to be ſeveral lines, ſome of a browniſh and ſome of a reddiſh colour, which looked like hairs, ſome lying Parallel to each other, and others more inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and I am apt to believe, that even Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds are not void of Particles of Heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous matter, which is countenanced not only by odd Clouds which I have ſeen in a great many of them, but the different ſpecifick Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of thoſe of the ſame Water, the difference amounting to a Carrat betwixt Diamonds of the ſize of two ordinary Peaſe.</p>
                     <p>But, beſides what hath been already offered, to prove that Gems have been once in a fluid form, it may be further alledged, that the Mineral Particles which they are ſo uniformly tinged with are convincing Arguments, ſince it is inconceivable how they ſhould otherwiſe be ſo impregnated. And to what hath been already delivered; I ſhall further add, what is delivered by a <hi>French</hi> Author, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Stones which are found in the Earth have their Water coloured by the Earth, whether it be fat and black, or abounds with black or red Sand, and in ſome the Gems have been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be black or yellow; but tho' this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath ſaid thus much which countenances our Hypotheſis, yet I muſt not omit to adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, that tho' he aſſerts Diamonds to be not only the hardeſt but heavieſt of Stones, I muſt yet

                     <p>But perhaps againſt what we have ſaid, It may be urged, firſt that the figures of theſe Cryſtals are ſo curious, that a Plaſtick or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Power ſeems requiſite to the forming of them; which were it requiſite, it might be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that that Plaſtick Power may be lodged in fluid as well as ſolid ſubſtances, ſince the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Parts of Animal Bodies as well as Plants are formed of liquid ſubſtances; but that the figures of theſe Cryſtals may be owing to an apt convenſion and coalition of fluid Particles may be argued hence, <hi>viz.</hi> Since common Salt, by the help of Oyl of Sulphur or of Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol and Water, will ſhoot into Cryſtals with Points like Diamonds, and not unlike native Cryſtal in ſhape and tranſparency; but if the Quality or proportion of the Oyl of Vitriol be varyed, they will ſhoot into Cryſtals ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of one ſhape and ſometimes of another, for the moſt part fiuely figured. And to ſhew that the regular figure of Sea-ſalt contributes not to ſuch figurations, I ſhall add, that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſſolved ſome Stony <hi>Stiriae,</hi> found in Caves or Grottoes, in Spirit of Verdigreaſe, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaporated the clear ſolution in a digeſtive Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace after the ordinary manner, it yielded ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a coagulated Maſs, than any thing like Cryſtals; whence it appears, that a concourſe of circumſtances may be ſufficient to determine the figures of conſiſtent Bodies, made of fluid ones; eſpecially ſince when I allowed a longer time for the fluid to ſhoot in, it afforded a
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:59609:795"/>good number of diſtinct Cryſtals; long, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, and curiouſly ſhaped.</p>
                     <p>And not only the external figure of Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalized Bodies may be accounted for, without he help of a Plaſtick Power, but their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Conſtruction likewiſe, ſince divers Bodies upon a ſlow coalition will form Concretes, ſome of which will conſiſt of ſtreaks, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of flakes; as lumps of <hi>Sal-Armoniack,</hi> which tho' a factitious Body, when broke will appear to be full of ſtreaks, like thoſe <hi>Stiriae</hi> obſerved in petrifying Water. And I have made artificial Concretes of Salts alone, or of Salts or Minerals, as Stones, or Antimony which look very like Talk, being white Bodies made up of a multitude of ſtreaky Particles, lying long ways one upon another as in that Mineral, and I have not only found Concretes ſhaped like <hi>Rhomhus</hi>'s or Lozenges, compoſed of a multitude of flat and extreamly thin Plates, but have imitated ſuch by Art. And I have obſerved, that tho' generally Cryſtals of Silver form flakes ſeemingly ſimple like ſcales of Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, yet when they have ſhot leaſurely they are Geometrically enough ſhaped, and made up of thin flakes ſticking one to another. And <hi>Tin-Glaſs</hi> which naturally conſiſts of a multitude of ſhining and poliſhed flakes, will, tho' beaten to Powder, and melted, upon its Refrigeration form ſeveral broad and ſhining flakes, which lying one upon another, croſs each other at various Angles, as the matter happens in ſeveral Portions to be variouſly refrigerated. And the like inſtances may be obſerved in ſome Mixtures of Copper, Iron, and other
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:59609:796"/>Minerals; and very conſpicuouſly in good <hi>Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Martis Stellatus,</hi> whoſe internal ſtructure appears upon breaking of it, to be made up of ſhining flakes, almoſt of a ſpecular Poliſh. And tho' whilſt we are looking on ſome Concretes, the Stony <hi>Stiriae</hi> in ſome places have a ſtreaky and in others an angular Configuration, yet I have ſeen ſeveral of them made up of Parts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly jumbled together, and if there be a due diſpoſition in the components Parts to ſuch Configurations, they may be brought to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes in a far ſhorter time than any one would expect or believe; ſo that a ſolution of Silver being heated hot, and removed ſuddenly into cold Water, one might not only very eaſily, but plainly ſee the Silver ſhoot with ones nak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Eye; but even a ſtrong Solution of <hi>Sal-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack,</hi> or ſome Urinous Spirit, being ſpread upon the outſide of a Glaſs in which a frigori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Mixture is contained, will in leſs than a minute of an hour be coagulated into Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals of a determinate figure, according to the Nature of the Liquor that afforded it.</p>
                     <p>But if againſt theſe inſtances it be urged, that tho' they are taken from ſaline Bodies, which are for the moſt part diſpoſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene into ſmooth Surfaces, and Angular ſhapes, and are eaſily wrought on by External Cold, yet it may ſeem ſtrange, that the figure of a Mould or Womb ſhould alter the Internal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of ſolid Minerals and Gems; but that it may is evident, ſince, tho' Tin-Glaſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of ſeveral ſmooth and bright Planes, which ſometimes meet, and ſometimes lye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:59609:796"/>each other, at very different Angles, yet having beaten a ſufficient quantity of it to Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and when it was melted caſt it into Iron Moulds, whoſe Cavities were each an Inch in Diameter, it formed a Bullet, which when varily broke ſeemed to be made up of a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſhining Planes, ſo ſhaped and placed that they rought every way like ſo many Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us's of a Sphere tending from a Centre to the Circumference, ſo that they ſeemed gradually to decreaſe, as they were removed further and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Circumference. But if the mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Tin-Glaſs was permitted to cool in a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, the hardened matter would form ſeveral Planes irregularly and confuſedly aſſociated to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And the like Experiment being tryed with <hi>Regulus</hi> of Antimony it ſucceded, tho' not ſo uniformly as with Tin-Glaſs: And melted Sulphur being hardened in the ſame Moulds, the Concreted Maſs ſeemed when broke to conſiſt of flakes like Straws lying Parallel to each other: But how the flakes of Tin-Glaſs came to be ſo regularly ſituated; and whether the outſide being firſt condenſed, the contiguous Liquor was connected by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, ſucceſſively as it moved within the cruſted Surface, or whether it was otherwiſe effected, I ſhall not now ſtay to examine; but to what I have ſaid I ſhall add, that having broke ſeveral Marchaſites of a peculiar ſort, I found them to conſiſt of ſeveral rows of Planes reaching from the inermoſt Parts to the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Surface; and in thoſe which were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Cylindrically ſhaped on the outſide, theſe Ranks of Gold coloured Particles, in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:59609:797"/>Planes of the broken Mineral ſeemed like <hi>Semi</hi>-Diameters iſſuing out from from a row of Phyſical Points, conceived to be placed on an Imaginary Line; lying almoſt like the Axes of a Cylinder between the appoſite ends; as if the Wombs wherein thoſe Marchaſites were found, contained the fluid matter as in Molds, and as if it Concreted there, as Tin-Glaſs or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulus</hi> did in the Molds.</p>
                     <p>But tho' from hence it may appear, that tho' the figures of ſuch Concretes be curious enough, yet they may eaſily be accounted for without a ſeminal Principle, yet I find not the uniformity of the figrue always ſo great as is imagined, but rather to depend on the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Figure and Texture of the Wombs they are contained in; for comparing <hi>American, African,</hi> and <hi>European</hi> Granats together, I found that one which weighed eleven grains and a half, tho it ſeemed to have been coagulated in a fluid <hi>Medium,</hi> and to conſiſt of twelve Plains, at the concourſe of two or three of which it ſeemed to have been broken off from the Root or Womb, yet it was not of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decahedron</hi> of Geometricians; for whereas that conſiſts of twelve equilateral and equiangled <hi>Pentagons;</hi> almoſt all the Planes that made up our Granate, were quadrilateral, and not of a regular ſhape or Magnitude; for one of them ſeemed to have five ſides; others reſembled a <hi>Rhombus,</hi> ſome a <hi>Rhomboides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> but moſt were a little bigger than the <hi>Trapezia</hi> But, beſides the want of uniformity in theſe Stones, I obſerved amongſt <hi>Corniſh</hi> Diamonds, that ſome of them were cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly and Geometrically ſhaped like Rock-Cryſtal,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:59609:797"/>having each ſix ſides, whereof every two that were oppoſite were equal to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and tho' the Stone had a Pyramidal Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, made up of ſeveral reſembling and curiouſly figured Planes, that terminated in a ſolid Angle or Apex, yet the greateſt number of the Titular Diamonds were made up of very irregularly ſhaped Stones; for tho' moſt of them had ſix long Planes, yet the oppoſite were moſt of them irregular and unlike; and tho' the Apex was made up of Planes apart uſually Angular, yet being compared with each other they were far from being uniform; tho' it appeared that they ſhot in a fluid Ambient, except at the bottom where they were faſtned to the Rock. And I have obſerved a great irregularity in the <hi>Area</hi> of the Superficial Planes, or their figures, or both, in Diamonds brought from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having ſhewn that the figures of Stones are far from diſcountenancing our conjectures of their Originals, I ſhall proceed to ſhew, that they help to confirm them; ſince I have ſeen a ſmall <hi>Corniſh</hi> Diamond ſo bedded in a large one, that it left a Cavity in it when ſeparated, and on the contrary I have ſometimes ſeen a large one ſo joyned to a ſmaller as to form a Cavity within it, which is a likely Argument, that the one being firſt hardened, afterwards a ſoft matter was collected together, and being contiguous, hardened in ſuch a form as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain part of the other in the Cavity, which was formed whilſt the one was fluid, and the other was hardened; which may be illuſtrated by conſidering, how Nitrous or Aluminous
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:59609:798"/>Salts faſten themſelves about pieces of ſticks, and leave a Cavity proportionably to the ſolid contained: To which I ſhall add, that I have ſeen a Stone which was taken out of a Silver Mine, which had coagulated about the Branches of a Silver Wire, which was produced by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the Mine.</p>
                     <p>Another Argument of the fluid ſtate of Gems, and their Impregnation with Mineral Stems, may be drawn from their Specifick Gravity, for whereas common Rock-Cryſtal is to its bulk of Water as two and almoſt two thirds to one, the weight of an <hi>American</hi> Granate was as four to one. And tho' by this method a tinged Gem hath not ſo great a difference in its proportion to Water, yet it may never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs be impregnated with Mineral Particles, for I found by Hydroſtatically weighing Water impregnated with Iron, that it was not much heavier than common Water.</p>
                     <p>Another Argument may be drawn from the Medicinal Virtues of Stones, and the Metalline or Mineral ſubſtances, as well from Opacous Stones as Opacous Gems, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quois, the Onyx, the Sardonix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as alſo Cats Eyes, Opates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And indeed I much queſtion whether Diaphaneity depends on the eſſence of a Gem; ſince it may rather proceed from the Poſition of the Parts of a Pigment, and the ſcituation of the Pores in reference to the Beams of Light: But waving a further conſideration of this matter, I ſhall rather ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn, that precious Stones and even Diamonds themſelves, have ſometimes great clouds, which makes them in thoſe Parts almoſt Opacous, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:59609:798"/>out being leſs of the Nature of true Diamonds. And it is obſervable that Cornelians and Agats are ſome of them tranſparent, and ſome of them Semidiaphanous, as the Portion of the Mineral Pigment is greater or leſs, or as it is more or leſs inconveniently mixed. And I have ſeen even a Sardonix tranſparent, and on the contrary, figured Granates which were both of them Diaphanous: And I have ſome by me of ſeveral Countries, which tho' they are in ſome places Diaphanous, yet in the main they are almoſt as dark as ordinary Stones. And I queſtion not, but that if the Glaſſy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Gems did not render common <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruums</hi> inacceſſable, Mineral Particles might be extracted from them; and when they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, I queſtion not but that they may be obtained from ſolid and tranſparent Gems; for having kept Granats in a hot Crucible till they changed their colour and afforded a very fine Powder, that being digeſted with rectifyed Spirit of Wine, afforded a curious Tincture; and burnt Granats gave <hi>Aqua Regis</hi> a Tincture, which in ſome meaſure reſembled a ſolution of Gold; but a drop of the Liquor being put to a great many drops of Tincture of Galls, it turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them as black as Ink, if not blacker. And the like meaſures being taken with Granates which were looked upon by ſome to be Rubies, the Tincture coloured an Infuſion of Galls not quite ſo black as the other; but a white Powder was precipitated at the ſame time; and by the uſe of an urinous Spirit a rediſh ſubſtance, which being dryed in the Air formed Bodies like Moſs, and here and there ſmall Muſhrooms prettily
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:59609:799"/>coloured. And from other Granates I obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Tincture, which after evaporation did in the Cold afford ſaline Concretions, but ſo ſmall that their figures could not be determined. And probably, were tryals made, other Mineral Concretes might be wrought on by appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> for tho' the Spar that is found in Lead Mines next the Veins of Ore be Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaphanous, and uſually breaks in ſmooth and Glaſſy Superficies, and looks like a Talck, and alſo for the moſt Part is made up of figured Particles ſhaped like <hi>Rhombuus</hi>'s or <hi>Rhomboides,</hi> yet I found it was a more open Body than Talk, being diſſolved in Spirit of Salt, without the aſſiſtance of Heat.</p>
                     <p>But I am apt to believe, that beſides the methods already mentioned, there are other methods to diſcover the Metalline Ingredients of a Body, by Fuſions and proper Additaments. And to conclude this Chapter, I ſhall ſubjoyn the following Experiment, <hi>viz.</hi> Having diſſolved Stony <hi>Stiriae</hi> of petrifyed Water, in Spirit of <hi>French</hi> Verdigreaſe, and after a gentle Evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, placed it in a cool place, it yielded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Containing a Conjecture about the Cauſes of the Virtues of Gems.</head>
                     <p>FROM what hath been elſewhere, and in the preceding Chapter laid down, it appears, that the Earth does not only abound with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Mineral and Metalline ſubſtances, a great many of which are undiſcoverd, and a great many already known, but alſo that ſeveral Mines are furniſhed with Water, which being impregnated variouſly, may be no diſpicable <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> but may likewiſe concur to the Production of Mineral Bodies, and not only ſerve as corroſive <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> but pure Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents to Mineral Earths. And that common Water is able to impregnate it ſelf not only with Saline but Mineral Parts, is evident from the various taſts of Waters, and their uſes; ſome being fitter for brewing; others for waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſome for dying particular Colours, and ſome to temper Steel; and others again for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſes: And amongſt the moſt remarkable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ies are <hi>Thermae</hi> and <hi>Acidulae</hi> reckoned up by various Authors, as alſo Salt Springs, and thoſe Waters of <hi>Hungary</hi> and other Parts, which yield a Vitriol, which is a ſubſtance com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and decompounded, containing a ſaline, a Sulphureous, a Metalline, and an Earthy Part; and if Water may be thus impregnated with Metalline Parts, it is no difficulty to apprehend how a Lapideſcent Humour, being ſufficiently
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:59609:800"/>mixed with and proportioned to it, may be coagulated into Stony <hi>Stiriae,</hi> and from ſuch like Coalitions may ariſe thoſe precious Stones, and tranſparent Gems; for the Virtue of ſpecifick Juices are ſo powerful, that I have ſeen Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſubſtances ſufficiently hardened by them to grave on Iron; and I had a ſubſtance which I looked upon to be a petrifyed Gum, which was hard enough to grave on Glaſs.</p>
                     <p>And if the Parts of Minerals may thus, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſſolved in Water, be mixed with a petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed Body, by this means Gems may not only be impregnated, but thence receive their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal Virtues, as the Nature of the Mineral is different in Qualities and abounds in Quantity, which Original of their Virtues may be rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed probable, not only by what hath been ſaid in the foregoing Chapter, but by their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent colours.</p>
                     <p>And that their Impregnation with Mineral Parts, enobles them with Medicinal Virtues, is evident from the Teſtimony of Experience, and is rendered probable by the Effects of a Loadſtone, which tho a much harder ſubſtance than ſome Gems, emits <hi>Effluvia</hi> very copiouſly, and hath not only manifeſt Effects on Iron, but Humane Bodies. And even thoſe Pebbles with which they counterfeit Diamonds, have been cauſed in a trice to emit copious and ſtrongly ſcented Steams; and even Diamonds the hardeſt of Gems, may by rubbing be cauſed to emit Electrical <hi>Effluvia.</hi> And tho' it be thought by ſome, that the digeſtion of a Man's Stomach is not able to extract the Metalline Parts, yet there may be a greater Congruity betwixt the
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:59609:800"/>Juices of our Bodies, and the Mineral ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with which they were impregnated, than we are aware of; beſides we ſee that the Stomach hath manifeſt Effects on Chalybe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Preparations, and even crude Steel it ſelf. And I have obtained a Tincture from ſeveral hard Bodies, and even Gems themſelves, by a Liquor diſtilled from a Vegetable ſubſtance, as temperately qualifyed as Bread. And that the natural Heat of our Bodies, may contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the extracting of the Virtues of preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Stones, I am perſwaded, ſince it makes an evident alteration in the hardeſt of them, ſo as to render a Diamond Electrical; and I have had one which by warm Water would be exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſhine in the dark.</p>
                     <p>And indeed it is not altogether improbable, that Gems having the moſt ſubtile Mineral Steams in them, being not diſperſed by the action of fire, they may be more Effectual conſidering their quantity, than Preparations of Metals which have undergone a Fuſion. And their Virtues may ſometimes be much different, upon the account of a great quantity of Mineral Particles, ſince <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>unzerus</hi> tells us, that amongſt thoſe Stones which are called <hi>Nephritick Stones,</hi> ſome are much more effectual than others, beſides the petrifick Juices themſelves may have diſtinct natures, and peculiar Qualities, upon the account of their Coalitions with Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious Liquors. And if petrifying Liquors may have ſuch manifeſt effects on ſeveral Bodies one would think indiſpoſed to petrify, why may not ſuch a Liquor ſubdue tranſparent Minerals abounding with Saline, Sulphureous, and Bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:59609:801"/>Bodies, which being excited may emit their moſt ſubtil Parts; and as in the Earth there are ſeverl Bodies compounded by the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Subterraneal fires, thoſe petrifyed may enable the Body with correſpondent Qualities; on which occaſion I here ſubjoyn, that I have ſeen a ſaline ſubſtance which was formed in the Bowels of the Earth, like that which is artificially made. And I have ſeen Volatile Salts and Sulphurs ſhoot into tranſparent Cryſtals in a fluid <hi>Medium</hi> after Diſtillation, which have been more curiouſly figured than ſeveral Gems. And if it be objected in disfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Medicinal Virtues of Gems, that they grow no lighter when they are ſaid to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <hi>Effluvia,</hi> I ſhall add, that, not to urge that the Antimonial Cup impregnates Wine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loſing of its ſubſtance, and that Mercury will give Water a Virtue of killing Worms, by being boiled in it, tho' by theſe means it loſes nothing of its weight, I ſhall rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand how it appears, that Bodies grow no lighter by the loſs of their <hi>Effluvia.</hi> And tho' in ſome caſes the Gem may be lighter than Cryſtal, yet it is no argument of their more languid Effects, ſince the ſpecifick Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thoſe Bodies they are impregnated with, may be of a ſaline Nature, and ſpecifically lighter than Cryſtal: And I ſhall in favour of this add, that I have ſeveral times made Bodies colourleſs like Cryſtal; and curiouſly and regularly figured, which were of a compound Nature, and abounded with an eaſily ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſtrongly ſcented Sulphur. And on this occaſion I ſhall further add, that tho'
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:59609:801"/>when Gems are ſpecifically heavier than Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal, it is an Argument of a Metalline ſubſtance mixed with them; yet ſometimes thoſe mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Particles may be ſo ſpirituous, as not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their ſpecifick Gravity, for I have ſeen a ferruginous Water, which, tho' ſtrongly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated, was little heavier than common Water.</p>
                     <p>And now, if, together with what hath been delivered in this Chapter, we reflect on what follows concerning the Atmoſpheres of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent Solids, and the efficacy of <hi>Effluviums,</hi> it will not be abſurd to aſcribe to precious Stones ſome Medicinal Virtues, eſpecially to thoſe that diſpoſed to emit copious <hi>Effluvia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And to ſhew that what we have deliver'd, may not only be applyed to tranſparent but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious Gems; and to render our <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> not only probable, but poſſible, I ſhall intimate, Firſt, That I have ſeen lapideſcent Juices ſo penetrating, as to turn ſeveral Animal and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable Subſtances into Stone; amongſt which, one was a new Cheeſe, which could be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd no otherwiſe from another Cheeſe, but by its ſtony Hardneſs; and I have a piece of Wood petrified, which retains its grain, and is hard enough to grave upon Iron or Glaſs, and to reſiſt the action of the Fire, and likewiſe to ſtrike Fire like an excellent Flint.</p>
                     <p>But to render this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> further probable, I ſhall ſubjoin the following Arguments. And, Firſt, It appears from the Method taken, to weigh Bodies in our <hi>Medicina Hydroſtatica,</hi> where White Marble was propoſed as a Standard, to determin whether Metalline parts were in
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:59609:802"/>Bodies or not; for a piece of White Marble being in proportion to its Bulk of Water, as 2 72/100 to 1; and Blood-ſtone, as 5 2/10 to 1; a Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, as 4 and 6/10 to 1; <hi>Lapis Calaminaris,</hi> as 4 7/10 to one; and <hi>Lapis Tutice</hi> as 5 to 1; It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that thoſe muſt proportionably be impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with Mineral Parts, heavier in ſpecie than Stone; and for that Reaſon I have found ſome Stones of the ſame kind ſpecifically heavier than others, as they were impregnated in <hi>Solutis Principiis,</hi> more or Ieſs with mineral Parts. But it will not be amiſs here to advertiſe, That ſome Stones lighter in ſpecie than Foſſils, may be compounded with mineral Parts, and thence deduce their Medicinal Virtues; and others may be impregnated with mineral Parts, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in ſpecie than Marble, and conſequently their mineral Nature cannot be Hydroſtatically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd as yet, which is to its Bulk of Water, as 1 22/100 to 1, and yields no inconſiderable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Oyl.</p>
                     <p>A Second Argument for the Confirmation of our <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> may be deduced from the Neceſſity of it, to explain ſeveral <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> as why Diamonds and other Gems ſhouldbe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in Rocks or Cluſters of hard Stones, which muſt be ſoft, or could not, at the firſt, admit a hard Gem to lodge amongſt their Parts; and I ſhall further urge the Neceſſity of it, from ſeveral Gems which I found in an odd kind of Mineral, ſent me from an <hi>American</hi> Colony. And it is not improbable, that Opacous Gems are petrified Earths, ſince they vary ſo much in their Dimenſions, ſo that I have heard of a Spleen-ſtone which weigh'd 80 Pound weight.
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:59609:802"/>And I have ſeen a Medicinal Stone, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſawed aſunder, its internal Parts were full of Cavities; whence it appeared to be made up of porous Earth petrifi'd, and not of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durated Liquor. From our <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Phaenomena</hi> may be explained, <hi>viz.</hi> Why ſometimes one part of a Gem is tinged with a Metal, and another is not, ſince in making Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial Gems, the Mineral Pigment hath tinged one Part without diſcolouring the other. And I have now by me a lump of petrifi'd Matter, which conſiſts of ſeveral Stones, which tho' firſt petrify'd apart, and afterwards joined together by a petreſcent Liquor, bear an uniform poliſh, without diſcovering betwixt their Parts the leaſt Commiſſures; and an acquaintance of mine diſcover'd ſeveral looſe Stones, where this was found, which were ſeparately of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and afterwards harden'd into ſtony Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, by the intervention of a petreſcent Liquor.</p>
                     <p>And I have an <hi>Agat</hi> by me, which ſeems to conſiſt of ſeveral Layers of Clay or Earth, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parallel to each other, and petrify'd part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into Tranſparent, and partly into Opacous Stones; and to favour this conjecture, I ſhall add, that I have ſeen ſeveral Layers of mineral Earths one upon another, within the compaſs of an Inch, which lay in different poſtures, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference both to the Horizon, and each other; and ſometimes the exterior ones ſucceſſively ſurrounded the interior; and ſeveral of theſe have been found in a ſmall compaſs of Ground; and by a like Method, differently coloured <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians</hi> and <hi>Jaſpers</hi> may be accounted for. And from hence may be deduced a Reaſon why
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:59609:803"/>Marchaſites and Flints, Wood and Shells, have been found encloſed in other hard Stones. And on this occaſion I ſhall add, that Stones which were partly Diaphanous, and partly Opacous, being calcin'd, the diaphanous Parts became White; and ſome others which were before tinged, had their Parts heighten'd ſo, as after Calcination to be of a rich and permanent Red; and this difference of Colours was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remarkable in the thin Layers, but in the ſpecks, and irregularly ſhaped Clouds, whether Greeniſh or Bluiſh.</p>
                     <p>And to illuſtrate an Obſervation formerly made on Diamonds bedded one within another, I ſhall urge what is obſerved in Cryftalizing Salts, where, as well as in a Metalline Solution, I have obſerv'd, that when a number of Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals had ſhot after the firſt Evaporation, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſucceſſive Layers ſhot upon thoſe; in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of which Solutions, the Cryſtals of one Layer were not only faſtened to the others, but differed conſiderably, as well in their Shape as Poſtures. In this Metalline Solution the Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral was only one, and the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> ſimple; but had the firſt been Compound, there would have been a greater diverſity, as likewiſe Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals of a compound Nature; as when a Solution of Salt-Petre and Sea-ſalt in Water is ſet to Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalize, where beſides Salts of reſulting Figures, a conſiderable part of the Sea-ſalt coagulates in the Form of imperfect Cubes about the Bottom, before the nitrous Particles ſhoot into Cryſtals of their own ſhape. And I ſhall further add, That Cryſtallization may not only be promoted by Evaporation, but by ſoaking part of the Water
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:59609:803"/>up either by immerſing it, or by placing dry Earth under the Solution, or ſome other porous Body. And by ſome Analogy to theſe Inſtances, we may conceive how ſome of the ſuperfluous Moiſture of a Petreſcent Liquor, being diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the remaining may be more apt to coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late; but by a moiſt Seaſon or ſupervening Cold, the moiſture ceaſing to be further diſperſed, the Coagulation may be for a time ſuſpended, and upon that account, upon the ſecond Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtallization, may yield Cryſtals leſs regular, and apt to convene uniformly with the others, than in Artificial concretions perform'd in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Veſſels. And on this occaſion I ſhall add, That I have had Fire-ſtones brought from ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Places, in one of which, the internal Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was very different from the more Central Texture; and in another, I not only obſerved one Spherical Stone contained within another, but of a different Texture, and diſtinguiſhed by a viſible Commiſſure, tho' the Commiſſure was not ſo uniform as to admit theſe two to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps it may be objected againſt what we have delivered, That theſe Bodies are found where petrifying Springs are not. Againſt which it may be offer'd, not to urge that Men and Beaſts have been petrify'd upon the ſudden invaſion of a petrifying Spirit, that Rain-Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may bring ſuch Particles along with it. Since over a Bath in <hi>Hungary,</hi> that abounded with petrifying Particles, the Steams which were arreſted by the building over it, were turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into ſtony Concretes; which may give us Reaſon to think, that petrifying Vapours raiſed
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:59609:804"/>from the lower Parts of the Earth, meeting with rightly diſpoſed Matter, may form Stones, without the help of Rain or Springs; which Conjecture may be favoured, by relating, that I have not only found an Earthy and Sulphureous Sediment in the bottom of Rain-water, but I have obſerved that a diſtill'd Liquor being kept ſome time in a Vial well ſtopp'd, the Steams penetrated the Cork, and formed whitiſh <hi>Stiriae,</hi> very ſlender and of a ſurprizing length. And that petreſcent Springs are not always requiſite, will appear, ſince I have found tranſparent Stones in a dry Soil, which lay upon a Rock; and I have found that a ſolution of ſtony <hi>Stiriae</hi> in Spirit of Verdigreaſe, being poured upon <hi>Bolus Armenus,</hi> contained in a Glaſs, when the ſuperfluous moiſture was exhaled, ſeveral tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparent and untinged Cryſtals appear'd, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed through that Red Earth. And the beſt petrify'd Wood that I know of, was taken up out of a Plot of ſandy Ground, where there was not the leaſt ſigns of a petrifying Spring. And tho' ſome Stones ſeem to grow as from a Root, yet theſe may eaſily be ſuppoſed to have been formed in certain Molds; and that after their formation, the Winds or Rains waſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the looſer Soil from their upper Parts. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it might be eaſily ſhewn, that ſtony Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions might be produced by the mechanical action of the Air upon the ſtony Parts, that ſucceſſively apply themſelves to the Matter that firſt begins to coagulate; and began to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken by that moiſture that accompanied thoſe Parts, and was neceſſary to their due Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their caſual Roots; in imitation of
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:59609:804"/>which I have obtained from ſaline and ſtony ſolutions, dry Turfs prettily ſigured, and dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanous or White; as alſo ſlender <hi>Stiriae</hi> that ſeemed to grow out of the ſolid Glaſs.</p>
                     <p>But further, ſometime petrifying Particles may be ſo diluted with ordinary Water, as not to diſcover themſelves 'till they have fit Bodies to work upon: For I have received tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and petrify'd Criſtals from a Lake in the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which grew to the Rocks in the bottom, but had no ill effects on the Fiſh which ſwam in that Water; and it is eaſie to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that whether Water which lies in the Cavities of Rocks be impregnated with petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Particles from Springs, Rain-water, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneal ſteams; I ſay it is eaſie to conceive, how theſe, after an Exhalation of the ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous moiſture, may petrifie the adjacent Soil, and form different Stones, according to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Nature of the petreſcent Liquors, and the diſpoſition and ſtructure of the Soil they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade; in which Soil if any Heterogeneous Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be lodged whether Vegetable, Animal, or Mineral Subſtances, they muſt needs be found in that petrify'd Soyl when broken up: Nor is it requiſite that this Soyl ſhould be all petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd at once; for it may be petrify'd gradually, as the Poſition or porouſneſs of the Body give advantage to the petrifying Body that works upon them; ſo that from hence it appears, how medicinal Stones of different Colours, Conſiſtencies and Effects, may be formed, and ſeem entire Bodies. And I have a Stone by me which contains a perfectly ſhaped Serpent coiled up in it, but without a Head; which
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:59609:805"/>appears to have been formed before the Stone, in as much as in the upper and lower Parts of the Stone, there are Cavities left, which toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther form one Cavity, of the ſize and ſhape of the contained Body; and that the Serpent and the Stone about it, were petrify'd at ſeveral times, may be argued from the different Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the petrify'd Animal, it being a clearer kind of Stone than that of the Mold; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that Part of the Mold it ſelf which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous to the included Body is whitiſh, and abounds with ſhining grains or flakes, in both which reſpects it differs from the other Parts.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed, in thoſe ſeveral places in which Stones are plentifully found, in times paſt pretreſcent Liquors may have been, ſince not only Earth-quakes, Inundations, ſinking of Grounds, but the incroaching of the Land on the Water, as well as fiery Eruptions, have been able to dry up Pools and Lakes, and to divert the courſe of Springs and Rivers, ſo as to leave not the leaſt footſteps where they flowed before.</p>
                     <p>Another Argument which will favour: the Hypotheſis already laid down, may be deduced from this, that by proper <hi>Menſtruums</hi> Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Parts may be drawn from ſome of theſe Stones, ſo a Solution of Blood-Stone turned an Infuſion or Galls blackiſh, and ſo did a Load-Stone Emeri and Marchaſites opened with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive <hi>Menſtruums.</hi> And <hi>Lapis Calaminaris</hi> kept in Fuſion with Copper, changes it yellow for a Golden colour, and makes it Braſs; and adds to its ſpecifick Gravity conſiderably.
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:59609:805"/>And Quick-ſilver is known to be diſtilled from Ore found in the Mines of <hi>Friuli.</hi> But as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore intimated, there are ſeveral Stones, which owe their Virtues to a Mixture of Bodies ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fically lighter than Cryſtal; which is evident, ſince not only Brimſtone, but Bitumens, are ſpecifically lighter, the proportion of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone being as two to one, and that of <hi>Aſphal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> as one and a little leſs than 4/10 to 1. And even ſome Bodies ſpecifically Lighter than Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal, may owe their Virtues to Mineral Particles, ſince they may be mixed with Ingredients ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally Lighter than Cryſtal, which may compenſate the Surpluſage of theirs; for I have had a piece of blackiſh <hi>Eaſt-Indian</hi> Flint, and likewiſe an <hi>Engliſh</hi> one of the ſame colour, the one of which weighed as 2 6/10 to 1, and the other as 2 7/10 to 1, which is equal to the ſpecifick Gravity of Cryſtal; ſo that the Blackiſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour ſeemed to proceed from ſome Mineral ſmoak that had pervaded it, which may give us Reaſon to believe, that the matter of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal Stones may be tinged with Mineral Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours before it is hardened: And that ſeveral ſubterraneal Bodies may be raiſed in the form of Vapours, will appear from what hath elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where been delivered; and that Quick-ſilver will, we are aſſured by the effects of Fumigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the <hi>Lues Venerea;</hi> and that it may be incorporated with Stones, may be obſerved in ſome kinds of native Cinnabar. And I have found that not only artificial but natural <hi>Sal-Armoniack,</hi> may be raiſed in the form of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations by the help of fire. And that <hi>Sal-Armoniack,</hi> Sulphur and Mercury, may be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limed
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:59609:806"/>into a Gold like ſubſtance, appears from the Preparations of <hi>Aurum Muſicum,</hi> and that the Earth abounds with Mineral Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations of various kinds, appears from what hath been elſewhere delivered; as well by us as ſeveral other Authors; and ſince the Earth abounds with ſo great a Number of Minerals, there is no queſtion but ſome of them may be able to penetrate and tinge ſome indurated Stones; and that a ſmall quantity of a Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral may be ſufficient to tinge a great quantity of a Stony ſubſtance, will appear from ſeveral Experiments already delivered.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed to the laſt Argument to be alledged on this occaſion, I ſhall add, that it appears that opacous Gems receive their Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues from Mineral Particles, ſince moſt of them conſiſt of Mineral Bodies petrified. And tho' moſt of theſe Bodies differ little from artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ones, we are not therefore to deny them Medicinal Virtues, ſince ſeveral Medicinal and ſpecifick Virtues are attributed to Chymical Preparations, and that artificial Bodies may be endewed with Medicinal Virtues, appears from <hi>Galen,</hi> who delivers the aſhes of a Cray-Fiſh as an Antidote againſt the biting of a mad Dog: And even Treacle is eſteemed not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as an Alexipharmick, but endewed with ſpecifick Virtues, upon the account of its mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt as well as occult Qualities. And to what I have ſaid, I ſhall add, that ſeveral Stones of the ſame kind differ in the goodneſs of their Medicinal Qualities, as <hi>Lapis Nephriticus;</hi> and ſeveral of them have Virtues which ſeem to belong to other kinds, when they are impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:59609:806"/>with the like Exhalations; ſo that I have ſeen a Blood-Stone which would ſtop Hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhagies when made uſe of without the Perſons knowledge, yet by its colour it ſeemed to be of another kind of Stone.</p>
                     <p>But to the foregoing Particulars I ſhall add, that ſubterraneal Exhalations may be ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and penetrating, as to petrifie both Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and Vegetable Subſtances, as appears from petrifyed Skulls, Bones, and pieces of Wood; and that Vegetable ſubſtances may be hardened into Stones is evident, ſince <hi>Lapis Lyncurius,</hi> a Stone near <hi>Naples,</hi> being rubbed and moiſtened, and then expoſed to the Sun in a due ſeaſon, will yield Muſhrooms fit to be eaten, ſo that the ſeminal Principles of Vegetables may be petrifyed, without loſing a power of exerting themſelves when they find an opportunity: And theſe kind of Stones are ſometimes found to be of an extraordinary bigneſs. And that other Earths, ſubject to be petrifyed, may be endewed with Medicinal Virtues appears, ſince I knew a Clay-Pit in which a Bed of Clay yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by diſtillation a Volatile and ſtrong Salt, which was a good Cordial, and a great opening and Diaphoretick Medicine. And that ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Salts, Sulphurs and Bitumens, may be met with in the Bowels of the Earth and in the Bodies of Stones, I have found by their Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Examens. And that Metalline Parts may concur to the Compoſition of a Medicinal Stone, may appear from native Sulphur, (which is it ſelf a compound Body) beſides a good proportion of Mineral Earth.</p>

And not only Volatile Salts are ſenſibly diminiſhed, by being expoſed to the Air, but Camphire which is a tough tenacious Body.

                     <p>And as further inſtances of the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of conſiſtent Bodies, we may add, that not only Apples but Eggs loſe of their weight in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſo does Wood; for having cauſed a Cup to be made of it, and Counterpoiſed it, it grew ſenſibly and gradually lighter, ſo that tho' it wanted two drachms of two ounces, yet it loſt forty grains of that weight in ten hours. And even Ice which weighed two oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in a froſty Night, loſt ten grains of its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer weight, tho' not in the leaſt thawed. And it is known to thoſe that deal amongſt Lead and Tin, that thoſe Bodies emit very hurtful <hi>Effluvia,</hi> and <hi>Cold-ſhare</hi> Iron hath been obſerved to ſmell ſo rank whilſt red hot,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:59609:807"/>that the Smith could ſcarce endure to work it; and not only Iron, but Braſs and Copper, when heated ſmell very unpleaſantly.</p>
                     <p>And to theſe inſtances I ſhall add, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Load-Stones, black Marble, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Stones, whilſt a Poliſhing, will emit ſenſible <hi>Effluvia,</hi> which is evident by the ſmells they emit. And amongſt other Bodies which convince us, that they emit ſenſible <hi>Effluvia</hi> by their ſmell, I ſhall enumerate thoſe Coni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Stones called Thunder-Stones, which upon attrition emit a Sulphureous ſmell; and ſo did a Subſtance which much reſembled a Marcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite: And I made a Mixture of a Metalline Body and a coagulated Mercury, which had conſiderable effects on the Eyes as well as other Parts, near which it was worn as an <hi>Appenſum.</hi> And <hi>Vitrum Saturni,</hi> made with a good quantity of Minium, is not devoid of Electricity; nor is Braſs free from an offenſive ſmell, when its Parts are put into a violent concuſſion by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>And amongſt Electrical Bodies I have ſeen ſome of ſo cloſe a Texture, and ſo hard, that they would ſtrike fire, and <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> it ſelf would not work upon them, as Cornelians, Rock-Cryſtal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And even ſo hard Bodies as Diamonds are found to be Electrical. And I have obſerved, that Concretions called <hi>Cugoli,</hi> made uſe of by Glaſs-men in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits a ſmell upon attrition; and ſo will a <hi>Calculus Humanus;</hi> and Iron it ſelf if held to a grinding Stone without the uſe of Water.

                     <pb n="414" facs="tcp:59609:808"/>
                     <p>And even ſo fixed Bodies, as <hi>Regulus</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony,</hi> and its Glaſs, communicate to Liquors Emetick and Purgative Emanations; and Glaſs it ſelf, which is fixed enough to endure the force of the Fire, upon Attrition, emits offenſive <hi>Effluvia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the Heat of the Sun and Fire have ſo great a ſtroke in exciting the Atmoſpheres of Bodies expoſed to them; that Amber being expoſed to the former, and Glaſs to the latter, they both became Electrical.</p>
                     <p>And I queſtion not, but that if a great many Bodies, not yet tryed, were carefully weighed, they would appear ſenſibly to emit <hi>Effluvia;</hi> tho' the waſte made by ſome Bodies is ſo ſmall, as to be ſcarce diſcernable, if at all, as in Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones, Ambergreaſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thoſe requiring a long time to make their Conſumption diſcernible, in which time we are not ſure but the Weights themſelves may have loſt of their weight, as well as the Counterpoiſe, and conſequently not be able to diſcover the loſs thoſe ſuſtain.</p>
                     <p>But there are ſeveral other, beſides ſtatical, ways of trying whether Bodies emit <hi>Effluvia</hi> or not; and there are ſeveral peculiar ways re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to cauſe them to emit them; as Glaſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> affect the Noſtrils upon an Attrition. I had a Diamond, as well as a Ruby, which would be excited by a gentle heat in my Pocket, or only by ſtrokeing my Finger over the former, tho' ſometimes they would fail to be ſo eaſily or u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformly excited; and it is not a little ſtrange, that upon the Tread of a Hare or Partridge, <hi>Effluvia</hi> ſhould be ſo long emitted, as to give a Scent to Dogs ſeveral Hours after.</p>

And if each of theſe Inches may, by Lines drawn from oppoſite Points, be divided each into 100 Parts, one Grain of Gold muſt be divided into 500000 little ſquares, diſcernable by a good Eye; and if an Inch were divided into 200 Parts, as I have one by me that is, then a Grain may be divided into 2000000 of ſquares. And to be ſatisfy'd further of the extenſibility of Gold, I enquired, and was told that 8 Grains of Gold would gild an Ounce of Silver Wire as fine as a Hair, and which would reach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt 90 and 100 Miles. But ſuppoſing the Wire to be as fine as that firſt mentioned, and that 8 Grains of Gold went to gild it; a ſheath of Gold weighing but 8 Grains, may be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo as to reach 60 times as much (in weight) of Silver Wire as it covers; and conſequently,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:59609:809"/>a grain of that Wire being twenty ſeven foot long, the ounce of Gold would reach to 777600 foot <hi>i. e.</hi> 155 ½ miles; and if this Gold Wire were cut into as ſmall thongs or liſts as poſibly it might be, it muſt reach to a ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious length.</p>
                     <p>But ſecondly, to ſhew into what a number of viſible Corpuſcles a Body may be divided, we put an ounce of Water into an <hi>Aeolipile,</hi> and having placed it upon a Chafing-diſh of Coals, we obſerved that Vapours ſtreamed out or above ſixteen minutes; and conſidering a few intermitting guſts afterwards, and what drops of Water were condenſed in the top of it, I gueſſed, that had the whole been driven out in Vapours they would have continued twenty minutes; <hi>N. B.</hi> to the Orifice of the <hi>Aeoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pile</hi> we applied a long Tube twenty Inches long and an Inch in Diameter, the remoter end being continued about ſix Inches longer, and ſo far expanded that its Diameter was four or five Inches; and by the help this Pipe we were able tho' not actly to meaſure the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of the rarified Vapours. To this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance I might add the prodigious expanſion of ſome Inflamable Bodies, when turned into actual flame, as Spirit of Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which being burnt in a Glaſs Lamp, ſo contrived that the Surface of the Liquor was ſtill Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, the waſte made in ¼ of an hour was very ſmall, tho' the Phyſical ſuperficies of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor muſt needs be ſucceſſively rarified and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded, and fly away in ſtreams; and if ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of this Liquor was able to afford matter for flame ſo long, the ſame bulk of a more compact
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:59609:810"/>Body may eaſily be ſuppoſed to be capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expanded to much greater Dimenſions. And to theſe inſtances I ſhall add, that half a grain of Gun-Powder being exploded under a Veſſel, whoſe <hi>Baſis</hi> was eight Inches and its Altitude twenty; and its figure ſuch, that it was more Capacious than a Cone of that ſize, the exploded Gun-Powder was obſerved to fill the whole Cavity of the Veſſel as to ſenſe, and ſucceſſively iſſued out of the upper Orifice for half a quarter of an hour, ſo that the Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it being two Inches, many Myriads of viſible Corpuſcles, muſt be conceived to throng out in ſo long a time as they crouded out one after another: But to make a kind of an eſtimate of the Expanſion of this Subſtance, we filled the Veſſel full of Water, and found that the weight of it amounted to 320000 half grains: And if we ſuppoſe the ſpecifick Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Gun-Powder to be as much again as that of Water, we my probably gueſs the ſmoak to poſſes 500000 times the ſpace that the Gun-Powder did. And as a further Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the great minuteneſs of ſmall Parts of matter, I ſhall urge the ſmallneſs of Cheeſe-mites; which being ſo ſmall as not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable to a naked Eye, but when they move, muſt be made of extremely fine Parts, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there would not be room enough for an Organical Body; and if an Organical Body fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with all the Parts requiſite for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Life be contained in ſo ſmall a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, how minute muſt they be at the firſt, ſince the Eggs out of which they are formed bear but a ſmall proportion to them, when perfectly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:59609:810"/>and even comparative Obſervations tell us, that a Mite being ten days a hatching, the Rudiments of its Body at the firſt muſt bear but a ſmall proportion to the bulk of that ſmall Egg; and to this I ſhall add, that tho' theſe Creatures be ſo very ſmall, yet I have been able to diſcern ſingle hairs growing upon their Legs.</p>
                     <p>Another inſtance of the Extenſion of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter minutely divided is this, <hi>viz.</hi> We diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved a grain of filings of Copper in Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniack;</hi> pouring the Solution into a tall Cylinder four Inches in Diameter, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively filling it four times with diſtilled Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſtill pouring it off into a Conical Glaſs; which being done, and the weight of the Glaſs Cylinder deducted from the Joint weight of the Liquor contained in it, we found that one grain of Copper was able to give à Tincture to 28534 times its weight of Water, tho' its ſpecifick Gravity is not half ſo much as that of fine Gold: and if we eſtimate the proportion not by weight but the bulk of theſe Bodies, the bulk of Water to Copper being as nine to one, the aforementioned number multiplyed by nine will give us the proportion betwixt the tinged and tinging the Body, ſo that one grain of Copper gives a colour to 256806 parts of Limpid Water, and by proſecuting this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment further, I found that it was able to give a manifeſt Tincture to above 385200, and a faint but diſcernable one to above 513620 times its bulk of Water.</p>
                     <pb n="420" facs="tcp:59609:811"/>
                     <p>To ſhew that the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of Bodies may enter in at very ſmall Pores, I ſhall intimate the effects of <hi>Cantharides</hi> held in the hands of ſome Perſons; and on the Neck of my own Bladder when applyed outwardly to my Neck. And not only <hi>Scaliger</hi> tells us of Spiders in <hi>Gaſcony,</hi> whoſe Virulent Poyſon would pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the Shooes of thoſe that trod upon them, but <hi>Piſo</hi> ſpeaking of a Fiſh called <hi>Amoreatim,</hi> and by the <hi>Portugals Peize ſola,</hi> he ſays, <hi>Quae mira ſane Efficacia non ſolum Manum vel le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſſimo attactu, ſed &amp; pedem, licet optime cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceatum, Piſcatoris incaute Piſciculum conterentis, Paralyſi &amp; ſtupore afficit, inſtar Torpedinis Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeae, ſed Minus durabili,</hi> Lib. 5. Cap. 14.</p>
                     <p>And to ſhew that ſome Emanations, even of ſolid Bodies, may be ſubtle enough to get through the Pores even of the cloſeſt Bodies; I ſhall add, that a needle being Hermetically ſealed up in a Glaſs Tube, and that laid upon Water, a Load-Stone would cauſe the Needle to leap up in it, and by the help of the Load-Stone, I could lead the Tube from one part of the Surface of the Water to another, as I moved the Load-Stone. And to ſhew that the Magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>Effluvia</hi> of the Earth, may penetrate ſo cloſe and compact a Body as Glaſs, I ſhall add, that a Cylindrical piece of Iron being ſealed up in a Glaſs Cylinder, and held in a Perpendicular Poſture, it acquired ſuch Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netical Virtues, as to become a North Pole, and according to Magnetical Laws to drive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the North Point of a Needle; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inverted, and held under the Point of a
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:59609:811"/>Needle, it became a <hi>South</hi> Pole, and attracted it.</p>
                     <p>Another Proof of the great ſubtlety of <hi>Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viums,</hi> may be taken from the ſmall decreaſe of Weight, by parting with ſtore of ſuch Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; as <hi>Vitrum Antimonii, Crocus Metallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> and Quick-ſilver, the two firſt of which give a Vomitive Virtue to a vaſt quantity of Wine, without growing ſenſibly lighter, and ſo Quick-ſilver impregnates Water with a Virtue of killing Worms. And a piece of Amber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greaſe which weighed about 100 or 120 Grains, being ſuſpended three days in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Air, loſt not ſenſibly of its Weight, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the quantity of odoriferous Steams it muſt have parted with in that time. <hi>Aſſa Foetida,</hi> in about ſix Days, loſt about half a quarter of a Grain; one Ounce of Nutmegs, in ſix Days, loſt 5 Grains ½; and an Ounce of Cloves, 7 grains ⅝. And tho' Loadſtones emit <hi>Effluvia</hi> without a ſenſible loſs of weight, yet I ſuſpect, that as theſe Magnetical Particles fly out of one Pole, they enter in at the other, and ſo make the Pores of the Load-ſtone their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Thorow-fares. To theſe Inſtances I ſhall add, that a Grain of Copper being diſſolved in a ſpoonful of a <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and that put into a Glaſs-Lamp, the Metal tinged the Flame, which continued half an Hour and ſix Minutes; ſo that ſuppoſing the Flame to have ſtreamed through a Cylindrical Pipe ſo long, that ſmall parcel of Metal muſt be divided into a vaſt Number of ſmall Parts; for Water, which ran through a Cylinder, whoſe Diameter was but half as great as that of the Flame, amounted to
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:59609:812"/>above Nine Gallons, or Seventy two Pounds.</p>
                     <p>The laſt Particular I ſhall inſiſt upon, to ſhew the ſtrauge ſubtlety of <hi>Effluviums,</hi> is the great quantity of ſpace a ſmall parcel of Matter may be extended to, and as to Senſe poſſeſs it; this we may be enabled to gueſs at, by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how long a Dog will diſtinguiſh the Scent of Partridges, Hares, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> after they have left the Place, and will almoſt give one ſufficient grounds to gueſs how long the Animal hath been gone from thence before. And I am told that a Blood-hound will not only perceive the Seent of a Man that hath gone over a piece of Ground ſeveral Hours before, but that the ſcent of a Deer will continue upon the Ground from one Day to the next. And if we conſider that the eighth part of a Grain, can ſcarce be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to be left on the Ground where ſuch an Animal hath ſtood, and likewiſe at what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance it may be ſcented, and how long that ſcent continues, it will be ſufficient to convince us of the extraordinary minuteneſs of thoſe Parts of Animals, which were rendered more apt to be diſſipated in <hi>Effluviums,</hi> by their having been firſt ſtrained through the Pores of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Nor is it leſs remarkable, that Birds, eſpecially Crows, are able to diſcover the ſmell of Gun-powder at a conſiderable diſtance; and that they are, I am ſatisfi'd by my own Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, as well as the Relations of others.</p>
                     <p>And on this occaſion I ſhall add, That <hi>Julius Palmarius,</hi> in his Tract <hi>de Morbis Contagioſis,</hi> obſerves, that Horſes, Beeves, Sheep, and other Animals, have grown mad by eating the Straw that mad Swine have lain on; which may give
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:59609:812"/>us Reaſon to ſuſpect, that the Feet of diſtemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Animals may leave an Infection upon the Graſs they tread on.</p>
                     <p>But to proſecute the chief aim of our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I ſhall add, That ſince Corpuſcles that are too minnte to be viſible, may affect an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan of Senſe; it is not improbable, but that there may be a great many which may be ſo fine as not to affect any one of our Senſes, and conſequently may continue an Atmoſphere much longer than we are able to take notice of. So <hi>Foreſtus</hi> tells us of a Peſtilential Contagion that was a long time preſerved in a Cobweb. And <hi>Alexander Benedictus</hi> tells us of a Flock-Bed, which, when ſeveral Years after the Plague, it was beaten, it preſently infected the By-ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. And <hi>Sennertus</hi> tells us that in <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ratiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> in ſix Months, ſix Thouſand Men dyed of the Plague; and that from that time, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection was preſerved in a Linnen Cloth, and being diſplayed in another Place, 13 Years after, it infected that Place likewiſe. And <hi>Trincavel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> tells us, that an Infection was preſerved a long time in Ropes, by which dead Perſons were let down into their Graves. And an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the like kind we are furniſhed with by <hi>Diemerbroeck,</hi> who acquaints us that an Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary of his, turning over ſome Straw, upon which a Bed had lain which held an infected Perſon, the Steams immediately cauſed Bliſters upon his Legs, and a Carbuncle which was a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tnight in healing. And to conclude this Chapter, I ſhall add, that I have a pair of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> perfum'd Gloves, which have continu'd their ſcent about Thirty Years, tho' they were not ſo much as ſhut up in a Box.</p>

                        </list> tho' they may perform ſeveral things conſiderable upon theſe Accounts; yet ſometimes two or three, or more, concur to the producing of the ſame effect.</p>
                     <p>And, Firſt, From what hath been deliver'd in the fore-going Chapter, it appears that the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of Bodies are very minute, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently it will follow, they muſt be numerous, and that a great number of ſmall Agents, when they act <hi>per Modum unius,</hi> may have conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Effects, is evident; ſince inundations of whole Countrie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may be cauſed by Showers of Rain when drops fall in multitudes; and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregates of ſmall Sands, not only bound the Seas, but form Banks, upon which the greateſt Ships are ſometimes ſplit; and tho' the Effects of a ſingle Grain of Gun-powder is immaterial, yet prodigious things may be done by a great number of them; and tho' Vapours are made up of very ſmall Particles, which ſeem to be ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:59609:813"/>yet in moiſt Weather, they cauſe Salts to melt, wood to ſwell, and Viol-ſtrings, if they be ſtretched too much, to break. And it hath been obſerved, that the inviſible Steams of a newly whited Room are ſo offenſive, that People who ſlept in ſuch Places, have been found dead in the Morning, being ſuffocated with thoſe Fumes; and tho' the Vapors which can iſſue out of ſuch Bodies at once, cannot be ſufficient to produce ſuch Effects, yet if we conſider that they continually ſucceed each other, as Wind out of an <hi>Aeolipile;</hi> their Number and Minuteneſs may enable them to cauſe conſiderable Effects.</p>
                     <p>And that the ſubtlety and penetrating Nature of <hi>Effluvia,</hi> contribute much to their Effects; appears, ſince good <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> and Spirit of <hi>Nitre</hi> are ſo penetrating, as in a little time to pervade the Corks with which the Bottle they are contain'd in are ſtopp'd, and to reduce them to a Pap. And running Mercury hath been found in the Heads of thoſe that have been too much expoſed to Mercureal Fumes. And in the Laboratories of <hi>Chymiſts,</hi> the Steams of Sulphur, Antimony, Arſnick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> make thoſe ſtagger that leſs cautiouſly unlute the Veſſels in which they have been ſublimed or diſtilled. To which Inſtances may be added, the infectious Steams in the <hi>Plague</hi> which ſuddenly infect the internal Parts; and likewiſe the ſudden. Effects of a <hi>Torpedo.</hi> And I prepar'd a <hi>Sal-Armoniac</hi> ſo powerful, that it reſtored a faculty of Smelling to one that had loſt it a conſiderable time; which Virtues it had, beſides thoſe more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ones, of affecting the Eyes, Mouth and Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. And on this occaſion, I ſhall ſubjoin, that
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:59609:814"/>the Steams of Water aſſiſted by warmth, are ſufficient to diſſolve hard and ſolid Bodies, ſo that by Philoſophical Calcination, ſolid pieces of Harts-horn are made ſo friable, as to be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reduced to Powder, only by being hung over the Steams of diſtill'd Waters: And to this I ſhall add, that under ſeveral Places in the <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Zone,</hi> the Dew is ſo penetrating, that it cauſes Knives to ruſt in their Sheaths, and Swords in their Scabbards, and even Watches in their Caſes: And in <hi>England</hi> I have known hard Bodies become friable by the inſinuation of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors into their Pores; and I have known ſolid and Mineral Bodies burſt, by the powerful inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of <hi>Effluviums.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And that the Celerity of the Motion of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute Bodies, may contribute much to their Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, appears from the Effects of Gun-powder, <hi>Aurum Fulminans,</hi> Flames, Whirl-Winds, and Winds. And I have made it appear, that thoſe Odoriferous Steams which ſwim in the Air, and affect our Noſtrils, are in too languid a Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 'till enabled to affect the Senſory more powerfully, by running through the Noſtrils in a Stream; and I have likewiſe made it appear, that Setting-Dogs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will be much more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with a Scent, when the Wind Blows from the ſcent towards their Noſtrils, than when it comes the contrary Way, the current of the Wind cauſing the Odoriferous Steams to affect the Senſory more briskly. And Electri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Bodies exert that Faculty more ſtrongly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Attrition, the emiſſion of their Electrical Steams being by that means excited: And the Learned <hi>Faber</hi> hath obſerved, that if a Hare was
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:59609:814"/>ſuſpended near an Electrick when the <hi>Effluviums</hi> were too briskly agitated, it would not be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, but driven away from it. And I know a certain ſubſtance made by diſtillation, whoſe ſmell in the Cold is very inoffenſive, but when it is warm, it emits Steams more ſtrong and penetrating than <hi>Sal Armoniac.</hi> And I have known ſolid Subſtances ſtink egregiouſly when excited to emit their <hi>Effluvia</hi> by Attrition. And as celerity of motion contributes to the Effects of ſubtile Bodies, ſo does the different modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Motion; for as a Stick or a Javelin, hath different Effects when they fly with one end firſt, from what they have when they twirled round with a certain Rotation; and the ſounds of Muſical Inſtruments are different, according to the different determination of their Motion, And the Impreſſions made upon the ambient Air.</p>
                     <p>And that, beſides what we have already ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of, the congruity or incongruity of the Particles of Matter, in reference to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies they are to work upon, contribute much to their Effects, appears from the Effects of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: For I have ſeen two tall drinking Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſo alter'd in their ſhape by the influence of Lightning, that the one was a little widened near the bottom, and the other ſo far bent, that it ſtood awry; the Beams of Lightning being able, in the twinkling of an Eye, to melt Glaſs; tho' in Glaſs Furnaces the Fire is ſometime be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can produce that Effect. And I once ſaw Lead melted by Lightning, which left the Glaſs unaffected; and likewiſe other combuſtible ſtuff that was near it; and tho' it left theſe Things
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:59609:815"/>untouched, yet it threw down part of a Wall, belonging to the Houſe, by paſſing through it. And it is a common Obſervation, that Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, either by giving a determinate Concuſſion to the Air, or tranſmitting ſome <hi>Effluvia,</hi> turns Beer ſowre; but having ſealed ſome up in Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Hermetically, the Thunder was not able to affect the Liquor contained in them; and it is a common practice to prevent Beer from ſowr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Storms of Thunder, to place Chafing-Diſhes of Coals under the Barrels, the ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous ſteams, being by that means ſo alter'd, as either not to be able to penetrate the Barrel, or not able to alter the Liquor.</p>
                     <p>Another Way, by which conſiderable Effects are cauſed by <hi>Effluvia,</hi> is by exciting ſuch a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Body they work upon, as to make one part of it act upon another. Inſtances of which may be brought from inanimate Bodies, as well as living ones, ſince ſome vigorous Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones deſtroy the attractive Virtues of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited Needle in a trice; or give it a Virtici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty quite contrary to the former, without touching it; and theſe magnetical Emiſſions which muſt needs be very minute, ſince they are ſubtle enough to penetrate Glaſs, are able to take up a conſiderable weight of Iron; ſo that I have ſeen a light one which would take up Eighty times its weight.</p>
                     <p>But the chief Inſtances I ſhall now inſiſt on, are thoſe wrought upon Animals; for it is evident, that our Organs of ſmelling are chiefly affected by ſuch minute Particles of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as the fineſt Odours conſiſt of; nor do they always affect us as Odours, ſince violent ſmells,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:59609:815"/>whether ſtinking or ſweet, are able to cauſe very troubleſome Head-achs. And the ſmell of a very pleaſing Perfume may produce in a humane Body, which before was well and ſtrong, both faintneſs, ſwoons, loſs of ſenſible Reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Intumeſcence of the Abdomen, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Epilepſies, Convulſive motions of the Limbs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And I had a <hi>Sal-Armoniack</hi> which would in a little time remove Hyſterick fits, and recover People, who by the by-ſtanders were judged to fall down in Epileptical fits, which ſudden effects ſeem to depend on the conſent of the <hi>Genus Nervoſum.</hi> But, beſides theſe effects of Odorous Bodies upon Women, I know a Man of a ſtrong Body and a ſanguine Conſtitution, who will be put into a violent Head-ach by the ſmell of Musk; and another to whom the ſmell of Roſes was as offenſive; and I know a Lady, who would preſently ſwoon at the ſmell of Roſes, if they were not ſpeedily removed. And as theſe ſlight ſmells have proved offenſive, ſo it is not much leſs conſiderable that the ſmell of <hi>Sal-Armoniack</hi> cures the Head-ach.

And I not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know a Gentleman who will Vomit upon the ſmell of Coffee, but a Phyſician who will Vomit and Purge, if he does but ſmell at <hi>Electuarium Lenitivum:</hi> And I know another whom the ſmell of the greaſe which is about the wheels of a Hackney-Coach will make ſick, and cauſe to Vomit, if it does but paſs by him.
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:59609:816"/>And not only ſmoak is offenſive to the Eyes and Lungs; but the inviſible ſteams of <hi>Sal-Armoniack.</hi> And beſides, the aforementioned inſtances of the effects of <hi>Effluvia</hi> upon the <hi>Genus Nervoſum,</hi> I ſhall add one of their Effects on the humours; for I know an Apothecary who upon the ſmell of Roſes, hath ſuch a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquation of Humours in his Head, that they ſet him a coughing, make him run at the Noſe, and give him a ſore Throat, and alſo by an affluence of humours make his Eyes ſore.</p>
                     <p>And as <hi>Effluvia</hi> may be enabled to perform ſeveral things on the account of the ſtructure of particular Bodies; ſo they may effect ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things, by Virtue of the Fabrick and Laws of the Univerſe, for Bodies by <hi>Effluvia</hi> may be rendered fit to be wrought on by Light Magnets, the Atmoſphere, Gravity, or ſome other Catholick Agent of the Univerſe. And to what inſtances have already been given of Bodies working upon others placed at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, I might add the effects of contiguous Bodies, as Bloodſtones, Cornelians, Nephri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Sones, <hi>Lapis Malacenſis,</hi> and ſome Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, and other ſolid Subſtances externally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by Phyſicians, as <hi>Cantharides,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Nature of Effluviums.</note>THO' <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and his followers, have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſhed the Exhalations of this Globe into thoſe which he calls fumes, and which riſing from the Earth, he terms hot and dry; and thoſe Vapours which riſe from the Water, which he calls hot and moiſt, in theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>; yet beſides theſe ſlight differences, ſince the Earth contains ſeveral Bodies, which have each of them diſtinct Atmoſphere, we may probably conceive them to have their diſtinct and determinate natures; and even in fluid Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Heterogeneous Parts may ſwim, which notwithſtanding their fluidity may retain their determinate Nature, ſince Rock-Allom and Salt-Petre being diſſolved together in Water, upon a gentle Evaporation, will each of them ſhoot into Cryſtals of their reſpective and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Natures.</p>
                     <p>And that <hi>Effluvia</hi> retain their determinate natures, tho' ſo ſmall as to ſwim in the Air or Water, appears, ſince upon their Re-union they are of the ſame Nature with the Body that emitted them; as Water raiſed in Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours condenſes again into drops of Water: And <hi>Quick-Silver</hi> in Diſtillation, if it be raiſed with a convenient fire, will almoſt all be found in the Receiver, in the form of running <hi>Mercury:</hi> And if when Chymiſts are either making an <hi>Amalgama,</hi> or forcing the Mercury
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:59609:817"/>away from it by the fire; they hold a piece of Gold in their Mouths, it will be white as if it were Silvered over. And not only Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, but Camphire ſublimed in cloſe Veſſels, unites into a Subſtance of the ſame Nature as the other, and tho' a Body be compounded of a Metal and another Mineral, and two or three Salts; yet upon the Purification of the Mixture from its groſſer Parts, if the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and finer Parts be minute enough and fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhaped, the wholy Liquor will aſcend; and yet in the Receiver altogether recover its priſtine form of a tranſparent fluid, compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of differing Saline and Mineral Parts, which is evident in the Diſtillation of Butter or Oyl of Antimony very well rectify'd; for this Liquor will paſs into the Receiver dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanous and fluid, tho', beſides the Particles of the ſublimate, it abounds with Antimonial Particles, carried over and kept inviſible by the corroding Salt: And I am told, that Tin will retain its own Nature in the form of fumes or flowers, which is evident, ſince that white ſublimate which is gathered above the Furnaces where the Ore is brought to Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion being melted down, will yield ſtore of Tin.</p>
                     <p>And beſides theſe ways, the determinate natures of <hi>Effluviums,</hi> may be diſtinguiſhed by their ſenſible Qualities, ſince the Exhalations which riſe from ſeveral Bodies produced by Art, appear to be of different colours; tho' no external Heat is employed to raiſe them; for the fumes of Spirit of Nitre well rectify'd, when cold and ſtopped up, appear in the
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:59609:817"/>Vial to be of a rediſh colour; and when the Veſſel is unſtopped they will aſcend in the form of a rediſh, or Orange tawny Smoak. And Spirit of Salt or Oyl, will when expoſed to the open Air, aſcend in the form of a white Smoak; and ſo will a Volatil Tincture of Sulphur made with Quick-lime; and both this and that of Salt-Petre do by their ſmell, as well as operation, diſcover of what Nature they are; and I have obſerved, that the eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Oyl of Wormwood, being drawn off in a Copper Alembick Tinned, was not only green, but retained that colour when rectify'd in a Glaſs-Veſſel; and tho' theſe eſſential Oyls be but the condenſed <hi>Effluvia</hi> of Vegetables, yet they retain the genuine taſte of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies from whence they were drawn. And not only Wormwood but Amber may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate their taſte, by <hi>Effluvia</hi> raiſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of Heat; for Wormwood having been kept in a cloſe Room, not only affected the Noſtrils ſtrongly, but the Tongue with a bitter taſte, and Amber kept in Spirit of Wine impregnated it ſufficiently to give it a genuine taſte, as well as ſmell; and that moſt eſſential Oyls retain their genuine Odours is very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
                     <p>And that the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of Bodies may affect even the Touch of Animals, may not only be argued from the effects perceived by ſome People upon changes of Weather, but by that memorable paſſage related by <hi>Diemerbroeck,</hi> who after he was cured of the Plague, it left ſuch a change in ſome Parts of his Body, that he ſays, <hi>Ab illo periculo ad contagioſos mihi ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propinquanti
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:59609:818"/>in emunctoriis ſucceſſit dolor, vix fallax Peſtis indicium.</hi> To which I ſhall add, that I knew one who could hear very ſoft whiſpers when ill of a Feaver, tho' the ſound and healthful ſtanders by could not; and I was told by a Lady, that ſhe could tell by her ſmell, whether one that came to viſit her had been in any place where the Ground was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Snow. And I knew a Gentleman, whoſe Eyes were ſo tender during a Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per he had in them, that he could diſcern and diſtinguiſh colours in the dark. And I am told, that a Blood-Hound found out a Man barely by ſcent, tho' he had paſſed through a Market Town, and ſeveral Crouds of People. And further inſtances may be brought from Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations made on Blood-Hounds, ſome of which will ſcent a Deer twenty four hours after. And a Gentleman told me, that he knew when his Dogs were in purſuit of a Fox or a Hare, becauſe they ran with their Noſes nearer the Ground after the latter, the ſcent of it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ſtrong. And I prepared a Body of a Vegetable Subſtance, which, tho' actually cold, would impart its colour to a Metalline Plate; tho' ſeparated from it by the interpoſition of a piece of Paper.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps it may be Objected by ſome, that theſe <hi>Effluviums</hi> may be altered by unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with each other in the Air. To which it may be anſwered, That they may nevertheleſs reſerve their determinate natures, tho' they act conjointly or ſo near it, that their diſtinct Operations cannot be perceived; as when two ſtrings of a Muſical Inſtrument are ſtruck at the
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:59609:818"/>ſame time, they both of them ſeem to make only one Impreſſion upon the Ear. And if Spirit of Nitre be dropped into Oyl of Tartar <hi>per deliquium,</hi> upon an Evaporation of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous moiſture, the Acid and Alkalious Particles will form Nitrous Concretions, whoſe taſte will be different from that of either of the ſeparate Ingredients: And ſo if an equal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of <hi>Sal-Armoniack,</hi> be added to a ſtrong ſolution of Pot-aſhes or Salt of Tartar, a ſubtil urinous Spirit will come over in Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; and alſo a <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> which is almoſt wholly a compounded Salt, differing enough from either of the Ingredients, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Alkalizate, in taſte and other Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And to theſe Inſtances I ſhall add, that ſeveral flowers being aptly mixed in a Noſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gay, and held at a diſtance they make a confuſed and joynt impreſſion upon the Organ of ſmell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and ſo do Perfume made up of ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients; and Spirit of fermented Urine, and of Wine being well dephlegmed, will incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate like Wine and Water, without affording the leaſt dry Sediment; but if in a convenient Veſſel, they be expoſed to a moderate Heat, the aſcending fumes will adhere to the upper part of the Glaſs, in the form of a white but tender Sublimate, different from either of the Liquors not only in conſiſtence but taſte and ſmell. And if Spirit of Salt and Nitre, be elevated by Diſtillation in the form of fumes, the condenſed Liquor will diſſolve Gold, tho' neither Spirit of Nitre nor of Salt would do ſo. And to demonſtrate the Coalition of ſteams in the Air, I ſhall add, that having filled two
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:59609:819"/>Vials, the one with Spirit of Salt, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniack</hi> well rectify'd, the aſcending fumes which before were inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, working one upon another in the Air, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed viſible ſteams, which appeared like Smoak, but when they were removed a greater diſtance from each other, the ſeparate and inviſible ſteams were no longer diſcernable. And one thing relating to this Experiment which was remarkable was, that a drop of Spirit of Salt hanging at the end of a Glaſs ſtick, being held over the Orifice of a Vial with a long Neck, the aſcending Vapours of <hi>Sal-Armoniack</hi> would form a Smoak, which would be viſible till it was a quarter of a yard above the Glaſs; but if the drop was held within the Neck of the Vial, the aforementioned fumes would fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ball of the Glaſs, like a ſtream of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, and ſpread it ſelf like a miſt upon the Surface of the <hi>Sal-Armoniack.</hi> Which Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may help us to account for the ſudden Invaſion of Meteors and Clouds, eſpecially in reference to the coming in or ceaſing of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Epidemical diſeaſes; and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the Plague, which ſeems to depend on the Occult temper, and alterations of the Air, differently impregnated with ſubterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>Effluvia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>An Inſtance of which is related by <hi>Diemer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broeck,</hi> who tells us of a Plague occaſion'd by waſhing of foul Linnen with Soap, the Fumes of the Smoak uniting with other <hi>Effluvia</hi> in the Air, cauſing that Effect; to which might be added, what is obſerved about the ceaſing of the <hi>Plague</hi> at <hi>Grand Cayro</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> but enough of
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:59609:819"/>that having been already delivered in another Place; I ſhall add here, that I have made a ſtain upon a Body by the inviſible ſteams and <hi>Effluvia</hi> of another cold Body; I altered the Colour of that Stain by the inviſible and cold ſteams of a Third.</p>
                     <p>And to countenance my Conjecture of the Cauſe of Meteors, beſides what hath been ſaid of ſubterraneal <hi>Effluvia</hi> in another Place, I ſhall add the following Citation from <hi>Agrico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la;</hi> who having mention'd, out of Ancient Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians, the raining of White and Red Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, ſubjoins. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t autem majorem fidem habea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Analium monumentis facit res, res illa de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantata, quae Patrium memoria in Suaevia acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit; Aer enim ille ſtillavit guttas, quae lineas ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes crucibus rubris, quaſi ſanguineis imbuebant.</hi> And it will not be thought ſtrange that ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneal Salts, Bitumens and Sulphurs, may be raiſed into the Air, if ſo fixed a Body as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Earth may, which the newly cited Author teſtifies. And that the odoriferous Particles of Plants reſerve their determinate Nature much longer than we are wont to imagine, may appear; ſince one drop of Oyl of Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon, gave not only a taſte to 14000 times its Bulk of Water, but withal, diffuſed a great number of odoriferous Particles through the ambient Air.</p>
                     <p>The Laſt way we ſhall mention to evince the determinate Nature of <hi>Effluviums,</hi> is from their Effects on other Bodies. As the ſtupefying <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvia</hi> of the Fiſh <hi>Amoreatim</hi> mentioned by <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</hi> The effects of <hi>Opium</hi> and Hypnoticks upon a Boy, who whilſt he was diſtilling them, caſt
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:59609:820"/>him into a ſleep. And the Root and Juice of Mandragora is ſaid to caſt thoſe that take it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a deep <hi>Sopor</hi> like a Lethargy; and <hi>Levinus Lemnius</hi> tells us, that the Apples of the ſame Plant being laid in his Study, made him ſo ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, that he could ſcarce recover himſelf: <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relaeus</hi> tells us, that the Poiſon of a Mad Dog hath been convey'd to one in the form of <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvia;</hi> and <hi>Calius Aurelianus</hi> acquaints us, That ſome have become mad by being wounded only by the Claws of a mad Dog; and that one fell into an <hi>Hydrophobia, ſolo odore ex rabido cane attracto.</hi> And <hi>Matthiolus</hi> tells us of one who was poiſoned only by putting his Hand into the Mouth of the mad Dog, without being bit; and to this I ſhall add, that <hi>Sennertus</hi> relates, that a Painter having opened a Box, in which Realgar had been contained, the Fumes being ſnuſſed up his Noſtrils, preſently cauſed a giddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his Head, and fainting Fits.</p>
                     <p>To theſe Inſtances I ſhall add, That ſeveral have been purged by the ſmell of Black Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore; and as <hi>Sennertus</hi> witneſſes by the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of <hi>Coloquintida;</hi> and there are ſeveral other Things which purge when only externally applyed: And it is atteſted by approved Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that the Shadow of a Wallnut-Tree, with the Leaves on it, is very hurtful to the Head. And it is not only obſerved, That Birds will not ſo much as light upon thoſe Poyſonous Trees in the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> called the <hi>Manchinello</hi>-Tree; and it is looked upon as ſafe for Men to eat of Fruit found in a ſtrange Country, if it appears that the Birds have been pecking at them before. And <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:59609:820"/>Florentinus</hi> tells us of one, who drawing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Noſtrils the Smoak of a burnt Spider, he was much diſordered, and fell into a faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fit, and was much diſordered about the Heart, his Pulſe being likewiſe weak; tho' after he was cur'd by a mixture of Treacle, Diamoſc. and the Powder of Zedoary. And I ſaw a Berry called Maccu-buy in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which being pounded in a Mortar, cauſed the Head and Face of one that ſtood hard by, to ſwell enormouſly. And,</p>
                     <p>To what hath been delivered of the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Nature of <hi>Effluviums,</hi> I ſhall add, that Amber, Musk, Civet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will communicate a Perfume to Gloves, tho at a diſtance off them; and contagious Diſtempers, as the <hi>Plague, Small-Pox,</hi> or <hi>Meaſles,</hi> may not only be communicated by immediate Contact, but by ſteams which iſſue from the Body of the ſick Perſon.</p>
                     <p>But to conclude this Chapter, I ſhall add the following Experiment, <hi>Viz.</hi> Having ſhut up an Ounce of a Volatile Tincture of Sulphur in a Vial, capable of holding at leaſt twice as much, and having placed a Paper at ſome diſtance, and unſtopped the Vial, the ſpreading Fumes preſently cauſed what was writ with inviſible Ink to become legible. And ſo would ſeveral Letters writ with a Solution of Sublimate in Water, ſome of them being more, and others leſs Black, according to their diſtances from the ſmoaking Liquor and other Circumſtances: And when the Paper thus writ upon, was held over the Orifice of the Vial, tho' the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were on the upper ſide, yet in a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:59609:821"/>of an Hour, they became legible; and as in ſome caſes, this ſmoaking Liquor, with a ſolution of Sublimate, will produce a Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate of a Silver Colour, ſo in ſome of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourleſs Ink we found the like Colour. And I have performed the like with a couple of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, wherein was neither Sulphur nor <hi>Sal-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac,</hi> nor Sublimate. And as a farther Proof of the great penetrancy of <hi>Effluviums,</hi> I ſhall add, that having a Paper which was writ on with this inviſible Ink, betwixt ſix folds of Paper, theſe Fumes penetrated it in Ten Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, and turned the Ink Black; and another piece of the ſame Inked Paper, being placed betwixt the Leaves of a Book, the ſteams pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated Twelve in three Minutes, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Ink blackiſh.</p>

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſs of Solids.</note>THAT even ſolid Bodies are not deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Pores, I am inclined to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, becauſe moſt ſolid Bodies, as Gems, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have once been in fluid Forms; and ſince Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ids are generally made up of Particles of a determinate ſize and ſhape, they muſt needs leave ſome Pores betwixt them.</p>
                     <p>Another Reaſon why I am inclined to think moſt Bodies porous, is their ſpecific gravity; which would not vary were the Parts of them equally compreſſed and cloſed
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:59609:821"/>together, but ſince Copper is heavier than Iron and Gold, as nineteen to one to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Water, and Copper only as nine to one, it muſt follow, that the matter of Iron poſſeſſes as much ſpace again as Gold and more. And tho' hardneſs is urged by ſome as an Argument of their Subſtance being condenſed, yet I have elſewhere ſhewn, that tho' Diamonds are the hardeſt Bodies, they are far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heavieſt, which is the only ſign whether they be condenſed or not.</p>
                     <p>And ſince Metals themſelves are made up of a Coalition of ſeveral Parts, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they ſhould be ſo Phyſically adapted, as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally <hi>implere ſpatium;</hi> ſince were Cubes made of Marble, it is impoſſible they ſhould be ſo exactly Poliſhed as every where to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous, ſince the Bodies employed to Poliſh them are obſerved to make little furrows up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and conſequently leave little Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals or Pores.</p>
                     <p>And that Wood is not void of Pores will appear, ſince Quick-ſilver hath been obſerved to penetrate the ſides of a hollow Cylindrical piece of Wood, and when the Air was drawn out of my Pneumatical Inſtrument, the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal preſſed ſo hard upon the outſide of a Board which covered it, that tho' it was of ſtrong Wood, and of a conſiderable thickneſs, yet it made its way into the Cavity of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, through the Pores of the Wood; and to theſe Inſtances I ſhall add, that the fumes of a Smoaking Liquor tinged a Copper Half-penny, through a broad thin ſhaving of Deal, tho' we could not diſcover any ſenſible Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foration;
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:59609:822"/>and the ſame Experiment being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain repeated with two, and a third with three ſhavings, they tinged the Copper Half-penny, tho' not in ſo little time, nor quite ſo conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly. And,</p>
                     <p>That baked Clay is not void of Pores is evident, ſince Oyl will ſoak through ſtrong and well baked Earthen Veſſels, and ſo will Solutions of Nitre and ſome other Salts; and very few except <hi>Haſſian</hi> Crucibles will keep Salt of Tartar long in Fuſion without being penetrated by them. And Vitriol and Salt-Petre have been obſerved to loſe much of their weight when diſtilled in Earthen Veſſels, the ſubtle and ſpirituous Parts flying away through their Pores. And I am told, that thoſe Juggs that are made of Earth, hardened ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently to ſtrike fire with a good Stell, have their Pores pervaded by the moſt ſubtle Parts of Spirituous Liquors; and it hath been found by Experience, that Spirituous Cyder hath ſweat through the ſides of Stone Bottles; which manifeſted it ſelf by its taſte: And I have found, that Silver diſſolved and turned into a horny Subſtance with <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept in Fuſion in an <hi>Haſſian</hi> Crucible, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Particles penetrated the Pores of it, and appeared on the outſide.</p>
                     <p>And to prove that natural Stones are po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, I ſhall intimate, that I had a Veſſel made of Stone ſent from the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> through whoſe Pores Water would ſweat; and if the Tranſparency or Opacity of Bodies proceeds from a rectitude or crookedneſs of Pores, which makes them fit or unfit to tranſmit the Rays
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:59609:822"/>of Light, <hi>Oculus Mundi</hi> will be an Argument of the Poroſity of Stones; ſince whilſt it is dry and in the Air it is opacous, but when it hath lain a while in the Water it becomes tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent like Amber, but ſoon loſes its Diapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neity when expoſed to the Air again, and ſo Paper wet with Water becomes more tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, but loſes of that Tranſparency when dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again; and to favour this explication, I ſhall add, that an <hi>Oculus Mundi</hi> having been weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after it was taken out of the Water, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be heavier than before. And ſince ſeveral Stones, as Granates, Emeri, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Mineaal Parts, it is impoſſible they ſhould be exactly contiguous without leaving ſome Pores betwixt them and the Parts of the Stone; and for the like Reaſon all artificial Gems made by Fuſion, and tinged with Heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Pigments muſt be ſuppoſed to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Pores; and ſince natural Gems are made up of Stony Ingredients, and Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Parts, for the ſame Reaſon we muſt ſuppoſe them to be furniſhed with Pores likewiſe; and the like may be concluded in reference to all Heterogeneous and compound Subſtances; as <hi>Marcaſites,</hi> Load-Stones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that white Marble is not void of pores may be argued not only from its eaſie Solution by <hi>Aqua For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> Spirit of Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but from its aptneſs to be tinged with Vapours, that are not fretting, ſo that red and other colours may be ſoaked into it as Oyl is into Wood. And having ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented ſome clear Fragments of native Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal with a compoſition of ſome Volatile Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, together with a Salt or two, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:59609:823"/>ſuffered the Crucibles to cool leiſurely, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the Fragments were ſtained here and there with different colours, ſome more and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers leſs dull; but whether the Tincture theſe pieces of Cryſtal received proceeded from ſome of the fineſt of the Mineral Parts, imbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed into the Stone when flawed with too much haſte; and whether upon cooling thoſe flaws did not grow too cloſe to be diſcernable to the Eye, I ſhall not determine, but ſhall add, that it hath been obſerved, that Rubies when Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed upon the Wheel, and very hot, have ſeemed full of cracks, which upon their cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly diſappeared.</p>
                     <p>And that Metals themſelves are porous may be argued, from their aptneſs to be diſſolved in proper <hi>Menſtruums.</hi> And eſpecially by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sulphur and thin Plates of Copper <hi>SSS,</hi> in a Crucible upon which another was luted, to keep the Sulphur from taking fire; for having kept them thus about three hours in a heat, which was ſufficient to melt the Sulphur, but not the Metal, when it was taken away from the fire and cooled, we found, that the Sulphur had ſo penetrated the Body of the Copper as to turn moſt of it into a brittle Subſtance, which would crumble away with ones fingers, being altered not only in Texture but colour, ſome being of a dirty dark colour, others of a violet, and many of the Plates when they were broken, ſeemed to have been divided into two Plates, and to have a manifeſt diſtance betwixt them, and we could likwiſe diſcern the fibers of the Metal, extend themſelves from one ſide of the Copper Plates to the other. And that the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:59609:823"/>penetrated into the Pores of the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-Plates might not only be diſcerned by their increaſe of weight, and bulk, but a Blue Flame which would diſcover it ſelf when they were laid upon quick Coles. And by a like Experiment, we found that the Body of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Tin, and Lead, might be penetrated. And not only Sulphur, but Arſnick will pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate thus into the Body of Metals. And I know a Pigment which tinged the Body of Copper, ſo as to give it the Colour of Gold: And Perfumes do not only continue long in the Pores of Glaſſes; but I am told by one, that he had a Watch, whoſe Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Caſe was richly perfumed. And I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member I made a Subſtance much like Gold, which retained ſeveral Mercurial Particles in it, and being caſt into a Ring, it was obſerved to have manifeſt Effects on the Eyes of ſeveral Perſons. And I am told that the Off-ſpring of the <hi>Granadine Moors,</hi> had an Art of curiouſly perfuming the Weapons they forged; and the ſame Nobleman who told me this, acquainted me that he had a Fowling-piece whoſe Barrel was perfumed, but its ſmell was much fainter after it had been ſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                     <p>And, Laſtly, To ſhew that even common Glaſs is not void of Pores, I ſhall reduce what I have to ſay, and compriſe it under the following Propoſitions.</p>

                           <hi>PROP. I.</hi> It's very probable, that Glaſs may be pierced into, at ſome diſtance, even by viſible and tangible Bodies.</head>
                        <p>And beſides the Arguments already offered to evince the poroſity of Bodies, I ſhall add, That a certain Spirit of Salt being kept in a Glaſs in a cool Place, it corroded ſome Parts ſo much as to leave them as thin as a piece of Paper; and lined with a white Subſtance, which ſeemed to be ſome of the <hi>Alkali</hi> of the Glaſs and Sand corroded by the Saline Spirits of the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and coagulated with them into this odd kind of concrete; and this wrought no higher than the Liquor contained in the Glaſs. And beſides this, I had another Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al corroded by a diſtilled Liquor of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> which contained more Phlegm than Oyl; and to this Relation I ſhall add, That a Pound of <hi>Dantzick</hi> Vitriol, and a Pound of Sea-Salt, the one calcin'd lightly, and the other decrepita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, being diſtilled in a well coated Retort, by degrees of Fire, giving at the laſt a very ſtrong one; when the Veſſel was taken off, we found that the Heat had here and there melted it; and that the <hi>Fluxed Caput Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum</hi> had corroded the Glaſs, fetching off Films from it; and thoſe Parts which did not appear to the Eye manifeſtly waſted; ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their brittleneſs to have been penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; ſo that their Texture was ſpoiled by the Saline and Vitriolate Particles.</p>

                           <hi>PROP. II.</hi> Common Glaſs is not ordinarily permeable by Chymical Liquors, tho' ſtrong and ſubtle, nor by the directly viſible or odorable expirations of Bodies; tho' abſolutely ſpeaking, it is permea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſome corporeal Subſtances.</head>
                        <p>And, Firſt, It is manifeſt, not only that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Spirituous Liquors and <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> may be kept in Glaſs Veſſels without ſweating through them, but even diſtilled in them; and I have found that neither Salt of Tartar would lent by being held in a Glaſs Bubble in the Water, nor would <hi>Sal-Armoniac</hi> penetrate it, ſo as to make its way out. But it is to be conſidered, that ſome Circumſtances may vary theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, as when the Texture of Glaſs is too lax and open; or when the Bodies are vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently agitated with Heat, or are too ſubtile; and have a certain congruity with the Pores of the Glaſs. For I have ſeen a ſort of Glaſs ſo ſoft, that not only hot Liquors, but moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Corroſives would work upon it; and I have heard, that ſome ſort of Glaſs is apt to be prejudiced by corroſive Liquors. And I was told by one, That he ſeveral times obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Gold to penetrate the Pores of Glaſs; and I have obſerv'd Fumes to make their way through the Pores of ordinary Glaſs, upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilling of Spirit of Harts-horn with a ſtrong Fire.</p>
                        <p>And that the Pores of Glaſs are penetrated by ſome Subſtances, is evident, by the Effects
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:59609:825"/>of Cold and Heat, on Bodies contained in ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Glaſſes; and that ſo groſs a Body as the <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluviums</hi> of Earth will penetrate Glaſs, and work on Iron contained in it: And Light it ſelf appears evidently to be contained in cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſealed Glaſſes; and by a cantinued Heat, I have found the Parts of Fire to penetrate Glaſs, and add to the weight of Iron ſealed up; and having tryed this Experiment with Filings of Copper, I found that their Colour was much altered, ſome of them being adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with exceeding vivid Dyes; which they yet retain without being increaſed in weight, as if they were not able to ſtick themſelves faſt enough in the Pores of the Metal, to add to its Gravity. And I had a Liquor which would va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry its Colour, as if ſomething in the Air was ſucceſſively communicated to it, and receded again.</p>
                        <p>And to theſe, other Inſtances may be brought from what may be obſerved in painting Glaſs; for the Pigment being laid upon the Glaſs, and that placed upon a Bed of Lime, and then continued in a violent Heat, the Pores of the Claſs will be ſo opened, as either to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibe the Parts of the Pigment, or to vitrifie and mix with it: And I have found, that by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prepared Silver upon Glaſs, and placing that upon live Coals; when it was nealed a while, by giving it a ſufficient degree of Heat, the Glaſs will acquire a Yellow, and almoſt a Golden Colour, which is not to be waſhed off; the way of preparing this Silver, is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the ſame, the Glaſs-painters uſually ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it Antimony, Yellow Okre, or the like.
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:59609:825"/>But ſince the Colour proceeds from the pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of the Silver into the Pores of the Glaſs; I uſually make uſe of the Powder of Silver calcined, by burning Sulphur upon thin Plates; and I have often coloured Glaſs barely by the uſe of Leaves of Silver laid upon the ſurface of the Glaſs, and moiſtened with ſomething to keep it from flying away. And I have often obſerved that tho' the Glaſs betwixt and the Light appeared Yellow, yet being held from it, it appeared Blue; which is a Confirmation of what we have inferred from the variation of Colours, in a Tincture of <hi>Lignum Nephri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticum; Viz.</hi> That they may be ſolved by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charical Principles. And that the Colour of Glaſs tinged, proceeds from an Incorporation of the Parts of a Pigment with it, tho' they penetrate not the whole Subſtance, but tinge the ſuperficies, (as I obſerved in Glaſs Plates, which were part of the Windows of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church before it was burnt) may be urged, ſince the Parts of the Silver may be wrought on by the fix'd Salts in the Glaſs, and afford different Colours, according to the difference of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that work upon them, as Copper with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Urine, give a deep Blue; with Spirit of Salt, a fair Green; and with <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour partaking of both. And in making Glaſs of Lead, with <hi>Minium</hi> and White Sand, or Cryſtal, the Glaſs will be of an Amethyſtine Colour, but if you add a due proportion of calcin'd Copper, the Metal will give it a good Green; ſo as to paſs for no bad <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And Gold incorporated with Mercury, and kept in digeſtion, when the Fire was once very vehement, it burſt the Veſſel, and flew away, but tinged the lower part of the Glaſs quite through, with a glorious Red Colour, not inferior to that of Rubies.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity of Animal Bodies.</note>THE Firſt Argument I ſhall urge for the Poroſity of Animal Bodies, is from their Structure; for ſince they are moſt of them compounded of diſſimilar, or ſimilar Parts, we cannot ſuppoſe thoſe ſo exactly united as not to leave Pores and Intervals betwixt them, whoſe Number and Variety muſt be very great.</p>
                     <p>A Second Argument of their Poroſity, may be deduced from the appoſition and conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Nutriment; and which may be illuſtrated by obſerving that thoſe moiſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles with which the Earth is moiſtened, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing agitated by the Heat of the Sun and Air, thoſe that happen to be commenſurate
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:59609:826"/>to the Pores of the Root are impelled into it, and thence conveighed into the other Parts of the Tree, being conveighed in the form of Sap, which paſſing through new ſtrainers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives alterations requiſite to turn it into Wood, Bark, Leaves, Fruit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in young thriving Animals it cannot be imagined, how the nouriſhment ſhould be conveighed to all the Parts, without ſuppoſing them furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Pores for its reception and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.</p>
                     <p>Another Argument of the Poroſity of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Bodies, may be brought from the plenty of Humours carried off by ſweat, and inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Tranſpiration. And by the help of good Microſcopes we may diſcern Pores in the skins of Animals, and eſpecially in the inward ſides of Gloves which are nothing but skins dreſſed; and they are further evident, ſince Quick-ſilver readily paſſes through the Pores of Sheeps skins, and leaves the droſs behind in the Leather; and the like I have tryed with the skin of a Man's Arm tanned, which Pores according to <hi>Steno</hi> and <hi>Malpighius,</hi> are the Excretory Veſſels of the <hi>Glandulae Miliares</hi> contained in the skin. And that the skins and ſhells of Eggs are not void of Pores, appears, ſince the moiſture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained is ſo far diſſipated through them as to diminiſh their weight. And <hi>Sanctorius</hi> in his <hi>Medicina Statica</hi> tells us, that if the Meat and Drink taken one day amounts to eight Pound, five Pound will be carried off by inſenſible Tranſpiration. And he elſewhere ſays, that in the ſpace of twenty four hours <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n the Winter time a healthful Body may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hale
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:59609:827"/>fifty ounces or more, a great part of which is carried off through the Pores of the Membranes of the <hi>Aſpera Arteria:</hi> And if ones finger in hot Weather be held to the Surface of any cold Body, it will preſently be ſullyed over with the ſteams that iſſue out of the Pores of the skin. And their Poroſity is further confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by obſerving, how ſoon thoſe black and blue ſpots in the skin occaſioned by bruiſes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved: for which uſe <hi>Helmont</hi> employs white Bryony root, and I have ſeen a Poulteſs of chop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Hyſſop and freſh Butter remove the Pain, and black colour of a contuſion in a little time.</p>
                     <p>And not only the Skins but the Membranes of Bodies are ſtocked with Pores, ſince the Bladder of a dead Animal appears to be full of them; for if Salt of Tartar be put into a Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and it be then immerſed in Water enough of it will penetrate the Bladder to diſſolve the Salt and render it Liquid; and the like ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but much more ſlowly when the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was tryed with Sugar; and ſome ſay, that Syrups made this way, inſtead of uſing or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Water, are much more preferable. And as a further inſtance of the Poroſity of the ſhells of Eggs, I ſhall add, that one having been immerſed in very ſharp Vinegar, tho' the ſhell was part of it conſumed, yet being taken out and wiped, it was conſiderably ſwelled and heavier than before, the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> being imbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and inſinuated into the Pores of it. And I am not only told, that the <hi>Chineſes</hi> had a way of ſalting Eggs, but I found by coating one over with Clay, after it had lain ſome time in
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:59609:827"/>Brine, the ſubſtance contained taſted evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Salt. And I know a Phyſician who was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with a giddineſs upon the uſe of Clyſters of Sack, and another told me, that having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed Tobacco to the ſore Leg of one of his Patients, it cauſed her Stomach to turn, or actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Vomiting; and another told me, that he uſed to Vomit himſelf, by applying Decoctions of Tobacco to his wriſts or other extream Parts, and it is a common cuſtom to Purge Children by the Application of external things; and it hath been obſerved, that Bathing the ſore Heads of Children, with a Decoction of Tobacco hath cauſed a giddineſs. And a <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> told me, that having taken another by the Hand, which was gently beſmeared with Oyl, it gave him three or four ſtools preſently.</p>
                     <p>And to what hath been delivered of the Poroſity of Membranes, I ſhall add the aptneſs of Lute-ſtrings, to imbibe into their Pores moiſt Particles; and alſo the <hi>Metaſtaſis</hi> or Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Morbifick matter in diſeaſed Bodies; as the matter which cauſes a Feaver, being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged upon the Brain cauſes a <hi>Delirium;</hi> and other Diſtempers as it is diſcharged upon the <hi>Pleura,</hi> the Membranes of the Cheſt, the Throat or Guts.</p>
                     <p>Another Argument of the Porouſneſs of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Bodies, may be drawn from their aptneſs to imbibe <hi>Effluvia</hi> from without, as when <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharides</hi> externally applyed affect the Bladder; to which inſtance may be added the effects of Plaſters, and Oyntments, and <hi>Pericarpia;</hi> for I have often cured Agues with a Mixture of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians, Hops, and Bay-Salt; and it is vulgarly
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:59609:828"/>known, that Mercury externally uſed in Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will ſalivate. To which may be added the effects of <hi>Periapta</hi> and <hi>Appenſa;</hi> of Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones in ſtopping of Hemorragies, and of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother kind of Stone made uſe of by the <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>Obſtructione Menſtruum.</hi> And I have found my ſelf that the Moſs of a dead Man's skull would ſtop an <hi>Hemorrhage,</hi> as ſoon as warmed by the contiguous skin. And <hi>Zwelfer</hi> tells us of one who preſerved ſeveral from the Plague, by uſing <hi>Helmonts</hi> Troches of Toads in Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets; and ſeveral of theſe Troches being put upon the Plague ſores of the infected, they were afterwards cured by the uſe of vulgar Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.</p>
                     <p>And to theſe I ſhall add, that having drawn a Spirit from a Mixture of flowers of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, powdered <hi>Sal-Armoniack,</hi> and good Quick-lime in equal quantities, by degrees of fire in a Retort till the ſand be red hot, if a piece of Copper be foulded up in Sheeps Leather, and held over the Vial it is contained in, the Metal will be tinged with the riſing fumes, without diſcolouring the Leather; and the ſame will ſucceed, only more ſlowly, through a double fold of Leather: And all the alteration the Leather received from theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading fumes was, that they gave it a ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous ſmell. And this Experiment may favour the accounts we have of the Effects of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which hath been obſerved to diſcolour the money in Men's Pockets, without burning them; and the ſame effect hath been taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of by ſome, who have aſcended a burning Mountain in <hi>America.</hi> And it is obſerved, that
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:59609:828"/>Lambs Leather hung up in the Air, acquires a moiſture, which adds conſiderably to its weight.</p>
                     <p>And to theſe inſtances may be added, the effects of <hi>Cantharides</hi> upon ſome that only carried them in their Pockets, the <hi>Effluviums</hi> of them having cauſed them to piſs Bloody Urine. And as a further Confirmation of the Porouſneſs of Bodies I ſhall ſubjoyn, that the Permeating Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor above mentioned had the like effect upon Copper, through the tough skin of an Egg, and likewiſe through a wet Sheeps Bladder; and to confirm what I have ſaid, of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſs of Animal Bodies I ſhall add, that a Gentleman who had a long time a Perforati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his <hi>Thorax,</hi> and was wont to inject me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated Liquor often to cheriſh the Parts, and likewiſe to wear a ſilken Bagg ſtuffed with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romaticks upon the Orifice, he not only had the Taſte of the Liquors in his Mouth, but the Aromatick Bag, when freſh, would perfume his Breath in Reſpiration. And <hi>Galen</hi> tells us, that Honey and Water having been injected into the <hi>Thorax,</hi> have been diſcharged through the <hi>Aſpera Arteria</hi> by coughing. And in a Man who was troubled with a dry ſhort Cough, we found ſome white curdled Matter betwixt the <hi>Pleura</hi> and the intercoſtal Muſcles, which ſeemed to occaſion the Cough by ſome noxious <hi>Effluvia</hi> tranſmitted to his Lungs.</p>
                     <p>And to theſe Inſtances I ſhall add, that it ſeems probable that theſe Humours collected in the <hi>Abdomen</hi> of an Hydropical Perſon, can be carrled off no other way but through the Pores of Membranes, upon the uſe of Diuretick and Purging Medicines. And an Inſtance not much
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:59609:829"/>inferior, is the Tranſlation of the Matter of an <hi>Empyreuma,</hi> ſo as to be voided by ſtool or U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine; and I have obſerved my ſelf, that when I have been preſent at the Diſſection of a Dog, whoſe Blood ſmelled very rank, the Excrements evacuated by ſiege, ſome time after, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Odour. And a famous Surgeon and Anatomiſt relates, That one who was ill of a <hi>Dropſey,</hi> judged to ariſe from a <hi>Schirrus</hi> of the <hi>Spleen;</hi> by applying a large Spunge dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in Quick-lime-water, to the Region of the <hi>Spleen,</hi> the <hi>Schirrus</hi> was diſſolved, and the Hydropical Humor evacuated. And <hi>Galen</hi> tells us, that part of the Humors collected, upon the breaking of a Bone, is diſcharged through the Skin, whilſt the <hi>Callus</hi> is a forming.</p>
                     <p>And not to repeat what Arguments have been already made uſe of, to prove the Poro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Animal Subſtances in general; that the Nails of Animals are porous, may be argued from their aptneſs to be tinged with a Soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Silver in <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> or of Gold in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua Regis;</hi> the former giving them a dark and black Colour; and the latter, tinging them with Purple Spots; which would continue, 'till by the growth of the Nail, they were forced to be pared off. And one thing in theſe Tinctures worthy our Notice is, that tho' the <hi>Menſtruums</hi> are Acid, and Corroſive, yet the Tinctures are not, the Taſte of the Tincture of Silver being bitter, and the other ſtyptick.</p>
                     <p>And the ſame method may be taken to prove the poroſity of Ivory; ſince a Tincture of Silver in <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> will tinge it with a dark and blackiſh Colour, which is not to be waſhed off.
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:59609:829"/>And I have long ſince tryed, that a Solution of Gold will give it a ſine purple Colour; and that too when both the Ivory and the Liquor were cold. Copper diſſolv'd in <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> ſtains Ivory with a bluiſh Colour. And even in the Cold without the Uſe of Corroſives, I have ſtained Ivory with a permanent Blue, like a Turquois, by ſuffering a Solution of Copper in <hi>Sal-Armoniac</hi> to dry upon it.</p>
                     <p>But to return to the Poroſity of Bones; it may be argued from the Marrow found in the Cavities of them; ſince nouriſhment muſt needs be conveyed to it, and it is not improbable that Blood Veſſels penetrate at the leaſt ſome depth into the ſubſtance of Bones, tho' the Juice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from them, may afterwards be convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the more internal Parts of them; for we ſee that the Lower Jaw is perforated by a Nerve, and alſo a Vein and an Artery to carry and return Blood for the Nouriſhment of the Teeth; and I have been told that Blood-veſſels have been obſerved by good Anatomiſts, to enter into the ſubſtances of larger Bones; and Blood hath not only been obſerved in the cavities of the Bones of younger Animals, but in the ſpungy Subſtance of ſeveral larger Bones. To which may be added in favour of their Poroſity; the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which they acquire when put into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent heat, and the fatneſs which they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford; as alſo their ſpecifick Lightneſs, and their aptneſs to be corroded with ſharp <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruums.</hi> And Bones are obſerved in moiſt Weather, not only to grow heavier, but they imbibe the moiſture of the Air ſo much, as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to ſwell. And to theſe Inſtances I ſhall
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:59609:830"/>ſubjoin what Obſervations I have made on large Ox-bones. <hi>Nov.</hi> 15. we weighed two (entire or unbroken) Marrow-bones, and found the one to weigh twenty nine Ounces half a Dram, and the other twenty four Ounces four Drams and thirty Grains. <hi>November</hi> 24. The former weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed twenty nine Ounces ſix Drams, and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter twenty five Ounces, one Dram, and thirty Grains. <hi>December</hi> 28. The former weighed twenty nine Ounces, three Drams, and fifty five Grains; and the latter twenty four Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſeven Drams, and thirty nine Grains. <hi>June</hi> 7th, The next Year the former weighed twenty nine Ounces, two Drams; and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter twenty four Ounces, ſeven Drams; from whence it appears, that Bones are Porous, ſince they imbibe and loſe moiſt <hi>Effluvia</hi> again. And that there may be Veſſels fine enough in the ſubſtance of Bones, to convey Nouriſhment, may be rendred probable, by what the Learned <hi>Sennertus</hi> hath obſerved, <hi>viz.</hi> That Hairs being cut in the <hi>Plica Polonica,</hi> they have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to bleed, ſo that they ſeem to be made up of a Bundle of cylindrical Pipes. And as a further Inſtance of the Poroſity of Bones, I ſhall add, that Mercury hath been found lodged in the Bones of thoſe that have been ſalivated in the Pox. And the ſame is atteſted by <hi>Euſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius Rudius (apud Sennet.)</hi> Lib. 5. <hi>de Morbis Acutis,</hi> Cap. 15. And what hath been ſaid may ſerve to favour the Uſe of <hi>Amulets</hi> and <hi>Periapta;</hi> or at leaſt diſcountenance their being too ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly rejected.</p>

                           <item>IV. Of the Heat of freſhly emitted Human Blood; which is obſerved to be much violenter after it hath run a while, than when it firſt began. The Blood that came out of the Veins of a young Gentlewoman, falling upon the Ball of a Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſcope, cauſed the Liquor to aſcend above an Inch nearer the ſmaller and upper Ball of the Glaſs. And in another Tryal it was raiſed almoſt as high as to the Ball of an ordinary Thermoſcope; but being held in the Blood of a healthful and luſty Man, the Heat raiſed the tinged Liquor a good way into the upper Ball; which was high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Heat of the Air in the <hi>Dog-days</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually does, and the Blood of a healthful Man continued its Heat ſo lo long, that it raiſed the tinged Liquor three or four Fingers breadth when it was coagulated.</item>
                           <item>V. Of the inflamability, and ſome other Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of Human Blood. A piece of Human Blood being dryed 'till it was fit to be powdered, and then held in the flame of a Candle, it took Fire, and afforded a flame not much unlike that which cauſed it, burning with a Crackling noiſe, and here and there melting; and if it was laid upon live Coals, and now and then blown, it
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:59609:831"/>would yield a very yellow Flame, and during its Deflagration, would ſeem to fry upon the Coals, and in a great meaſure to melt into a Black Subſtance almoſt like Pitch. And ſome of the Powder of Blood being caſt into the flame of a Candle, they took Fire in their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and flaſhed not without ſome noiſe, as if they had been Roſin.</item>

But to make an Eſtimate of its Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Gravity, we took the Blood of a ſound Man, and put it into an oblong Glaſs; and when it was ſetled, we marked with a Diamond, that part of the Glaſs to which the Liquor wrought; and then weighing the Glaſs, and the Blood contained in a very Tender Ballance; we poured out the Blood, and having waſhed the Veſſel, we filled it up to the ſame Mark, and then weighed it in the ſame Ballance; and then weighing the Glaſs, and deducting that from the weight of the Glaſs, and the two Liquors, the Water weighed nine Ounces, ſix Drams, and fifty Grains. And the Blood equal to it in Bulk, weighed ten Ounces two Drams, and four Grains, ſo that the Blood being three Drams and fourteen Grains heavier, it was about <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                           <item>XI. Of the Liquors and Salts that coagulate Human Blood. Clotted Blood being kept ſome Hours in Spirit of Wine, which is a <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum</hi> fit to diſſolve ſome Bodies, it was taken out as hard as if it had been dryed by the Fire.</item>

                              <p>XIX. Of the Volatil Salt of Human Blood, and of its Figures. This Salt is ſo fuſible, that one part of it may be brought to boil, whilſt the other flies way; and this Obſervation will hold in moſt Volatil Salts. And tho' this Salt, when ſublimed, looks white and Clean, and a very homogeneous ſubſtance, yet I am apt to
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:59609:832"/>think, that it is made up of Parts of Matter of ſizes and ſhapes different enough, for having weighed ſome Grains of re-ſublimed Salt of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Blood, that ſeemed pure, its ſmell was very ſtrong and diffuſive, ſo that one would have expected it to fly away in a little time, but we obſerved that it was very little diminiſhed in ſeven or eight days time; yet what remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed had loſt its Odour, but retained a ſaline Taſte; and being put upon a Solution of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limate in common Water, turned it White, ſo that its diffuſive and penetrant Humour ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to depend on ſome more volatil Parts of the Blood. But it may be a Queſtion to be ſolv'd by further Experience, whether the fixedneſs of this Salt may not proceed from the Coalition of an Acid Salt in the Air.</p>
                              <p>A Dram of Volatile Salt of Human Blood ſublimed in a Lamp-furnace, was put into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Water, and when a Thermoſcope was brought to its right temper, being immerſed in this mixture, the tinged Spirit of Wine mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly ſubſided about 2/10 parts of an Inch; tho' a conſiderable part of the Salt lay undiſſolved in the bottom of the Water. And when the Liquor would deſcend no further, we added to the Solution ſtrong Spirit of Nitre, 'till it would no longer make a manifeſt Conflict with the Salt; and then we obſerved, that whilſt the Conflict laſted, the Spirit of Wine roſe above three Inches and a half higher than the ſtation it ſtood at before. The figure of this Salt may be either conſidered in reference to ſingle Grains, or an Aggregate of them, when they are raiſed and ſublimed to the top of the Glaſs;
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:59609:833"/>the latter of which may be beſt obſerved, when they faſten themſelves to the inſide of the Glaſs that is ſet to receive them; for in the begining of the Operation, one may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the little ſaline Concretions to lye in rows, ſometimes ſtraight enough, and ſometimes more or leſs crooked, with different Coherings and Interferings, ſo that they ſometimes repreſent either Trees, or their Branches or Harts-horn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are caſual figurations depending on ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral accidental cauſes and circumſtances, as the degree of fire made uſe of to ſublime the Salt, the quantity of the aſcending matter in reference to the Capacity of the Veſſel that receives it. And the like diverſity of Configu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations I have obſerved amongſt the Salts of other Volatile Salts, as well as thoſe of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Blood. And as for the ſingle grains of the Salt of Human Blood, I diſcovered a good many of them to be finely ſhaped; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were accidental or not, experience muſt determine. But theſe figures were only obſerved in the ſublimate of the firſt Diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for thoſe obtained by rectifying the Salt and diſtilling it again, were of a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable bigneſs and ſolidity tho' differently ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, ſome of them being <hi>Cubes,</hi> others <hi>Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelopipeds,</hi> others <hi>Octoedrons,</hi> being almoſt like grains of Allom; but moſt of them prettily ſhaped; being comprehended by Planes, ſmooth, finely figured, and aptly terminating in ſolid Angles, as if the concretions had been cut and poliſhed.</p>
                              <p>Another way I took to diſcover the figures of the Salts of the Blood, was to rectifie the
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:59609:833"/>Spirit, ſo that it may be fully ſatiated with the Salt, whilſt the Liquor continues warm; for when it is refrigerated, a number of ſaline Concretions of different ſizes, ſeveral of which ſhoot into very ſmooth Cryſtalline Plates pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily figured, having their broad and parallel Surfaces of an Hexagonal or an Octogonal figure, regular enough.</p>
                              <p>A drachm of dry Volatile Salt of Blood, being diſſolved in ſome diſtilled Water, we dropped into it good Spirit of Nitre, till the two Liquors would no longer manifeſtly act one upon another, and when the conflict ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we ſlowly evaporated the ſuperfiuous moiſture, which ſteamed almoſt all away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſaline part would coagulate. At length it became dry, and the middlemoſt part ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the form of thin Cryſtals, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like thoſe of Salt Petre; but the reſt which was by much the greateſt part of the Concretion, ſeemed to be a confuſed maſs without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct figure; and this maſs weighed but twelve grains above a drachm; ſo that Volatile Salt of Blood may be ſatiated with a fifth part of its weight of the ſaline Parts of Spirit of Nitre. This Salt expoſed to the open Air in a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow was very apt to run <hi>per Deliquium,</hi> and a little of it being put upon a live Coal, it melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſeemed to boil; and towards the end made a noiſe, and afforded a flame yellower than that of common Nitre.</p>
                           </item>
                           <item>XX. Of the Phlegm of diſtilled Human Blood.</item>
                           <item>
                              <p>XXI. Of the two Oyls of Human Blood. By diſtillation in a Retort, it affords an Empy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reumatical
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:59609:834"/>and a very fetid Oyl, whoſe colour is almoſt black; which ſeems to be occaſioned by the increaſe and opacous redneſs of the Liquor, ſince ſome of it being ſpread thin upon Glaſs, and held againſt the light, appeared yellow, or of a reddiſh colour, as they lay thicker or thiner upon it, but when it was well dryed before committed to Diſtillation, it yielded a greater quantity of Oyl, ſo that once out of a Pound of not over-dryed Blood, we obtained an ounce and a half of Oyl, and from another we had a much greater quantity of Oyl. And having once prepared Blood by a convenient Digeſtion, and rectified very carefully the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled Liquor that came over with the flame of a Lamp, I obtained amongſt other things two Oyls of very different colours; the one being of a pale Amber or yellow colour, and the other of a deep red; and tho' theſe Oyls were both of them afforded by the ſame Blood, and were clear and pure enough; yet they would ſwim in diſtinct Maſſes one over another, and if mixed by ſhaking would again ſeparate like Oyl and Water. Whether the difference in ſpecifick Gravity betwixt theſe two Oyls, kept them from mixing permanently, as well as it kept them diſtinct before they were mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; or whether the ſeeming incongruity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the Texture of theſe Liquors I ſhall not now ſtay to diſpute.</p>
                              <p>To ſhew that the Oyl of Human Blood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſeveral ſaline Particles, capable of being ſeparated from it, we put a parcel of unrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Oyl, to a convenient quantity of diſtilled Water, and having mixed them ſufficiently by
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:59609:834"/>agitation, ſo that the Water might rob the Oyl of its ſeparate ſaline Particles, the event was that after the Liquors were well ſetled, the Water was found to be impregnated with ſaline Particles, that it obtained by diſſilution from the Oyl; ſo that it acquired a moderatly brisk taſte, and would readily turn Syrup of Violets green; and precipitate a white Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der out of a ſolution of Sublimate; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the like will ſucceed with other Empyreu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Oyls or not, drawn from Bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Animal Kingdom, I ſhall leave o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to determine.</p>
                              <p>Having put ſome unrectified Oyl of Human Blood into a concave piece of Glaſs, and then dropped as much Oyl of Vitriol into it, as might amount to a third or fourth part of the fetid Oyl, we ſtirred them together with a ſlender piece of ſolid Glaſs, upon which the Mixture emitted ſtore of whitiſh fumes or Smoak; and acquired a conſiderable degree of Heat, ſo that tho' it amounted to not much more than a ſpoonful, yet I was not able to hold my finger under that Part of the Glaſs, that contained the Liquor.</p>
                              <p>Having taken ſome Empyreumatical Oyl of Human Blood unrectified, tho' it was dark, and groſs, and muddy, yet it would eaſily in the cold diſſolve in rectified Urinous Spirits, to which it gave a reddiſh colour deep e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
                           </item>
                           <item>XXII. Of the fixed Salt of Human Blood. To obtain but one ounce of it, there is requiſite to employ a conſiderable quantity of Blood; and duly prepared by a very obſtinate fire; for the
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:59609:835"/>
                              <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> being kept three or four hours in the fire, it will yield no fixed Salt at all: But having by an obſtinate Calcination obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed three or four drachms of this Salt, I found that it was of the Nature of common or Sea-ſalt, tho' a little different; for it taſted like it, and a ſtrong ſolution did not readily turn Syrup of Violets green, nor precipitate a Brick colour, or browniſh yellow, no more than a white Powder, out of a ſolution of Sublimate; nor did the Spirit of Salt diſſolve it as an Alkaly. And having put a little Oyl of Vitriol upon our dryed Salt, it immediatly, as it ſeveral times did upon common Salt, corroded it with great violence, and with much foam and Smoak. We alſo dropped a little of it diſſolved in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, upon a ſolution of Silver made in <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> upon which a white Powder was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly precipitated: And having put ſome Leaf-Gold upon <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> which would not work upon it, whilſt it was ſwimming there without being ſo much as diſcoloured, I put a little of our powdered Salt into it, which being thereby turned into a kind of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, did without the aſſiſtance of Heat, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently diſſolve it.</item>
                           <item>XXIII. Of the <hi>Terra Damnata</hi> of Human Blood. From twenty four ounces of dryed Blood, we got after two days Calcination, but two drachms and nine grains of Earth; which probably was not pure Earth, ſince it had a red colour like that of <hi>Colchotar</hi> of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol.</item>
                           <item>XXIV. Of the Proportion of the differing Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances Chymically obtain'd from Human Blood.
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:59609:835"/>they are ſcarce to be determin'd, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſometimes great diſparity, as to proportion, that may be met with of the fibrous part to the <hi>Serum,</hi> in the Blood of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Perſons; but of the ſame, according to different Circumſtances, and alſo, becauſe it is hard to diſtil the pulveriſed part of the Blood; ſince no one hath ſo much as taken notice of the Neceſſity of ſhifting the Retort, to gain as much Volatile Subſtance as may be obtained; and leave as little as may be in the <hi>Caput Mortuum.</hi> For having diſtilled a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of dryed Blood, the ſame Heat which made the lower part paſs in the form of Exhalations into the Receiver, made the matter to ſwell, ſo that it lifted up a conſiderable quantity of Black Matter to the upper part of the Veſſel, which a common Diſtiller would have called a <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> tho' to a diſcerning Eye, it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be of the ſame Nature with the Matter firſt put in, tho' blackened by the aſcending Fumes, therefore taking it out, and mixing it with the remaining Subſtance, that was more of the Nature of <hi>Caput Mortuum;</hi> it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted again to Diſtillation in another Retort, whereby we obtained more Oyl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And perceiving that even this <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> had upon the top of it, a pretty deal of Matter, which was not ſufficiently deſpirited, I cauſed it to be diſtilled again in a freſh Retort, in which it afforded a not contemptible quantity of Volatile Matter. And having thus in three Retorts diſtilled twenty four Ounces of dryed Human Blood, we obtained of Volatile Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,

                              <hi>viz.</hi> Spirit, together with a little Phlegm, White Salt, and very high colour'd Oyl thirteen Ounces and one Dram, beſides ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parcels of thick Oyl that ſtuck to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torts and the Receiver, which we judged to be ſeven Drams more; ſo that the whole Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Volatile Part amounted to fourteen Ounces, of which the Oyl was ſix Ounces ſix Drams, and the clear Liquor ſix Ounces, three Drams and a half, beſides the Volatile Salt, which, when the Spirit was drained from it, appeared white but wet; ſo that it was not poſſible to determine exactly, neither how much Liquor it yet retained, nor how much it ſelf weighed; but it will be no hard matter to gueſs near the Truth to any Man that knows, that having carefully ſublimed the Salt, there remained in the Glaſs two Drams and five Grains of Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Liquor; which was not wholly void of Salt; and of Volatil Salt in a dry form, we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained one Ounce and two Drams and a half; the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> amounting to eight Ounces and a half, and ſomewhat more, which being calcined for two or three Days together, afforded not White, but brouniſh-red Aſhes, whence we obtained ſeven Drams ¼ of White and fixed, but not a truly lixiviate Salt; and two Drams and nine Grains of Earth. But indeed conſidering the great proportion of each of theſe Subſtances loſt in diſtillations, it will, upon that account, be a hard matter to determine the true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the Principles of Human Blood.</item>

                        <p>HAving ſeparately weighed the <hi>Serum,</hi> and the conſiſtent part of the Blood, the latter weighed four ounces, ſix drachms and a half, and the former three ounces, ſix drachms. And having taken the ſame meaſures with the Blood drawn from another Perſon, the fibrous part weighed four ounces, five drachms, and the <hi>Serum</hi> four ounces. But from theſe Experiments it does not follow, that the fibrous part is alone heavier than the <hi>Serum;</hi> ſince a great deal of the latter is diſperſed through the Pores of the former,
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:59609:838"/>which appears, ſince four ounces, five drachms, and thirty four grains of the fibrous part of Blood being diſtilled in a digeſtive Furnace, the dryed Blood remaining weighed but one ounce, three drachms, and thirty four grains; whereas the ſerous Liquor diſtilled from it amounted to three ounces, fifty three grains; and the like tryal being again repeated with another parcel of Blood, the dryed maſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to one ounce, ſix drachms, and fifty grains; and the Phlegmatick Liquor diſtilled from it, to ſeven ounces.</p>
                        <p>Red Sealing-Wax ſuſpended at a Hair, weighed in the Air one drachm, fifty ſix grains; in Water thirty five; in <hi>Serum</hi> thirty three. And having made uſe of an Inſtrument pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely made, when common Water weighed 253 grains, an equal bulk of <hi>Serum</hi> weighed 302; and the <hi>Serum</hi> of the Blood of another Perſon being weighed, it wanted but two grains of the weight of the former.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Serum</hi> which was tinged with Blood being ſtrained through Cap-Paper, the Liquor which paſſed through it was of a yellow colour.</p>
                        <p>Spirit of Salt being dropped into <hi>Serum,</hi> coagulated ſome Parts, which ſubſided in the form of Cheeſe-Curd; and Oyl of Vitriol had the ſame effect, but more powerfully: But Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Sal-Armoniack</hi> rather made it fluid. Oyl of Tartar <hi>per Deliquium</hi> produced a white Curd, by uniting with ſome Parts of the <hi>Serum,</hi> but not ſo powerfully as the other had done. Spirit of Wine rectified produced a copious white Curd, but ſo ſoft that it ſwam upon the top of the Liquor.</p>
                        <pb n="476" facs="tcp:59609:839"/>
                        <p>Upon an infuſion of a ſolution of Sublimate, it yielded a white Curd; but ſome of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> of Human Blood being poured upon filings of Iron, the Liquor diſſolved ſome of the Steel; which appeared, ſince upon an addition of ſome of an infuſion of Galls, the Liquor which before was muddy and thick, laid down a whitiſh Sediment; and a convenient quantity of the infuſion being added, the two Liquors united into a conſiſtent Body, wherein the Eye diſcovered no diſtinct Liquor at all.</p>
                        <p>But having put ſome of our Liquor upon filings of Copper, which, when wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Bodies that have in them any thing of Urinous Salt, uſually give a conſpicuous Tincture, we accordingly found, that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal was in a few hours diſcoloured by the <hi>Menſtruum;</hi> and afterwards it began gradually to grow more blue, and in a day was of a deep Ceruleous colour: And to ſhew that this colour proceeded from ſome Volatile Salt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in the <hi>Serum,</hi> we mixed ſome of it with Syrup of Violets, and found that it appeared of a fine green. And one thing obſervable in the <hi>Serum</hi> impregnated with Copper was, that I kept it ſeveral weeks in my Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow without perceiving that it in the leaſt ſunk.</p>
                        <p>About two ounces of <hi>Serum</hi> was left in a South Window three weeks in the Month of <hi>July;</hi> but did not appear in the leaſt putrified; but had let down a conſiderable Sediment, and in three or four days after it ſtunk offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively; and that at the ſame time it was void of Acidity appeared, ſince it would not take
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:59609:839"/>off the blue colour of a Tincture of <hi>Lignum Nephriticum.</hi> This fetid <hi>Serum</hi> being diſtilled in a low Cucurbite, the Liquor that firſt came over was ſo little Spirituous or Saline, that it would not in an hours time turn Syrup of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olets green; yet that it was not without a Volatile Alkaly appeared, ſince being dropped into a good ſolution of Sublimate, it cauſed it to lay down a white precipitate.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Serum</hi> of Human Blood filtred through Cap-Paper, being diſtilled in a ſmall Retort placed in a Sand Furnace; we obtained only a few drops of a darkiſh red Oyl, ſome of which ſubſided to the bottom of the other Liquor, but the greater part ſwam upon it; and after a good deal of inſipid Phlegm had been drawn off, there came over a good proportion of Spirituous Liquor, which ſmelled almoſt like the Spirit of Blood, and contained a pretty deal of Volatile Alkaly; ſo that it would rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily turn Syrup of Violets green, and cauſe a white precipitate, and ferment with Spirit of Salt. And this Spirit being rectified in a ſmall Head and Body, a good quantity of a thick Subſtance like Honey was left in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Glaſs, which was for the moſt part of a dark red, and ſeemed to contain more Oyl than appeared upon the firſt Diſtillation. The Liquor that came over the Helm was purer, but not ſtronger than the firſt; but having put it into a Glaſs-Egg with a ſlender Neck, and given the Veſſel a convenient Scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in hot Sand, we obtained a Volatile Alkaly, that ſublimed into the Neck in the form of a white Salt; from whence it ſeems
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:59609:840"/>to follow, that the ſerous part of the Blood affords the ſame Elementary Principles or Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar Subſtances, both as to number and kind, as the fibrous and conſiſtent part, tho' not as to quantity; that of the Oyl and dry Salt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſs in a determinate proportion of <hi>Serum,</hi> than of Blood.</p>
                        <p>Tho' it be neceſſary, to looſen the Spirit of Urine from the more droſſy Parts of it, that before Diſtillation it ſhould putrefie for about ſix weeks, yet if freſh Urine be poured upon Quick-Lime a great part of the Spirit will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently be united, and aſcend in Diſtillation: Encouraged by which Obſervation, I mixed <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> with Quick-Lime, upon which there enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a tranſient Heat; and this mixed Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing committed to Diſtillation, firſt it afforded a Phlegm in a gentle fire; and then in a ſtronger, a moderate quantity of Liquor, that was thought to ſmell manifeſtly of the Lime, but had not a brisk taſte; and this was accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed with a greater quantity of fetid Oyl than was expected. The other Liquor being ſlowly rectified, the Spirit which firſt came over had a ſtrong and piercing ſmell, but leſs rank than common Spirit of Human Blood: Its taſte was ſomewhat fiery, and being drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped upon Spirit of Violets it preſently turned it green; in a ſolution of ſublimate with Water, and another of Quick-ſilver in <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> it preſently made two white precipitates. And being mingled with ſome good Spirit of Sea-Salt, there appeared a thick and whitiſh Smoak, but neither any viſible conflict nor bubbles; yet the colour of the Spirit of Salt
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:59609:840"/>ſeemed much heightned by this operation. And here I ſhall obſerve, that having ſet the lately mentioned Mixture of the Spirit of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> and of Salt to evaporate, the Salt afforded by it was not like that of <hi>Sal-Armoniack,</hi> but the colour produced in the Mixture whilſt fluid, was ſo heightned in the Concrete, that it appeared of a Blood-red colour; but of ſuch a confuſed ſhape, that it could not be reduced to any kind of Salt; by all which Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na this Spirit of the ſerous part of the Blood, ſeems to be very near of kin to that of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creted maſs.</p>
                        <p>To try whether the fixed Salt of Pot-aſhes would have the ſame effect on <hi>Serum</hi> of Human Blood, to four Parts of Liquor we put one of Salt, and having diſtilled them ſlowly in a Glaſs-Head and Body, we obtained a good ſtore of a Liquor, but not near ſo ſtrong as that drawn off from Quick-Lime; and having rectified this Spirit by a gentle Heat, the two firſt ſpoonfuls which roſe were not Spirituous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but Phlegmatick; nor would it turn Syrup of Violets green, tho' it afforded a light Sublimate when put upon a ſolution of Sublimate.</p>
                        <p>Having put one part of Salt of Pot-aſhes into three of Human Urine, and ſlowly diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them in a Head and Body; firſt a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Liquor aſcended; which being ſet aſide, we continued the Diſtillation till the remains appeared dry: in which operation we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained not one drop of oyl; beſides which it was obſervable that this Spirit of Urine was not near ſo fetid, as that made
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:59609:841"/>the common way; and that that Liquor which came over at the latter end of the Diſtillation, was ſo unlike that which the <hi>Serum</hi> of the Blood affords us, that it was not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably ſtrong, and manifeſtly ſtronger than that which firſt aſcended, but had a penetrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and fiery taſte which left a laſting impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon the Tongue, and made a notable Ebullition with Spirit of Salt, which the Spirit of Urine drawn from Quick-Lime did not; and whereas in the laſt Liquor I never obſerved any Volatile Salt to aſcend in a dry form, in the operation made by the help of Salt of Pot-aſhes, there aſcended without Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, ſeveral grains of Volatile Salt, one of which was Cryſtalline and very large, ſo that it appeared to be like a Plate curiouſly figured; but ſome leſſer corns of Salt hiding one part of it, I could not clearly diſcern whether it were Hexagonal or Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonal. And this Experiment being repeated a ſecond time, the Liquor aſcending was more Phlegmatick, tho' we both times applyed Salt of Pot-aſhes taken out of the ſame Veſſel, and the Urine of the ſame Perſon; but this Liquor being rectified <hi>per ſe,</hi> afforded more of a brisk ſaline Spirit, from which we obtained a pretty quantity of Volatile Salt in a dry form, and of a very white colour.</p>
                        <p>Having put betwixt two and three ounces of <hi>Serum</hi> of Human Blood into a Bolt-head, capable of holding four times as much, and having ſealed the Glaſs Hermetically, and ſet it aſide, we obſerved the following Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
                        <pb n="481" facs="tcp:59609:841"/>
                        <p>Firſt, No alteration appeared in the Liquor for twelve Months, nor were any Worms or Magots bred in it; and tho' it be generally believed, that Inſects naturally breed in the fluid Parts of Human Bodies, yet I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that if Blood be ſo exactly cloſed up, that Flies cannot blow upon it, and that too before it is putrified, or blowed upon, it will not breed them.</p>
                        <p>But, Secondly, In this Liquor there appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the leaſt Mother which uſually accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Putrefaction; but the tip of the ſealed Glaſs being broken off, a pretty deal of Air ruſhed out with a conſidarable noiſe; and that this Air had been conſiderably compreſſed, whilſt it was penned up appeared, ſince upon its eruption a multitude of bubbles remained on the Surface of the Liquor, as upon the opening of Botled Drink, or other Liquors, when the Veſſels they are contained in come to be unſtopped. And to theſe Obſervations, I ſhall add, that ſome Sheeps Blood being ſhut up in <hi>Vacuo,</hi> upon a gentle Putrefaction, the Elaſtick and Aerial Particles that were produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced blew it up, with a ſurprizing noiſe. But, Thirdly,</p>
                        <p>The ſmell of our <hi>Serum</hi> was ſtrong but not Cadavarous; rather reſembling that of the Tincture of Sulphur made with Salt of Tartar and Spirit of Wine, or ſome ſuch Sulphureous preparation.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, This <hi>Serum</hi> being committed to Diſtillation in a ſmall Glaſs Head and Body in a digeſtive Furnace, the Liquor which firſt came over, firſt ſmelled ſtrong enough, yet
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:59609:842"/>taſted not at all brisk or ſpirituous, like that diſtilled from putrefied Urine, nor did it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently give a manifeſt greenneſs to Syrup of Violets; but in a ſolution of Sublimate, it had the ſame effect with Spirit of Urine or a Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Salt. And having mixed ſome of it with Syrup of Violets, ſpread all night upon white Paper, and another parcel of it with filings of Copper, the former in the Morning was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed green; and the latter was ſo far diſſolved, as to leave a large blue ſtain upon the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
                        <p>One part of Salt of Tartar being diſſolved in eight Parts of <hi>Serum</hi> of Human Blood, and ſtirred over a gentle Heat, it was not turned red by it as Milk is. That Blood will be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulated by Heat in a ſhort time into a kind of Gelly, is a common Obſervation. But having put Spirit of Human Blood into <hi>Serum,</hi> and kept it a convenient time over a fire, the Volatile Alkaly ſeemed to make the coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation more ſlow. And this effect was more conſiderable, when we tryed another parcel of <hi>Serum</hi> with Salt of Tartar inſtead of Spirit of Blood.</p>

                           <p>COnſidering that Fevers have been looked upon to proceed from a Fermentation in the Blood; and likewiſe, that Human Urine which hath a great Cognation with Human Blood, will not whilſt freſh afford a Spirit, till the Phlegm be firſt drawn off; this Subject of this Title may not appear Groundleſs. But I am not much encouraged to expect a Vinous or ardent Spirit from Human Blood, nor am I ſure there is any ſuch thing as Fermentation in Human Blood. And on this occaſion I ſhall add, that having once kept Blood Hermetical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſealed up in a Glaſs for twelve Months, when it came to be opened, it ſmelled ſo offenſively, that we could not make any tryal upon it; and another time having digeſted, in a pretty large Vial Hermetically ſealed ſome Sheeps Blood; when it had been a good while in the digeſtive Furnace, it ſuddenly broke with a conſiderable noiſe, and blew off the long neck of the Vial. And here, to what hath been laid down, I ſhall add, That ſome Ounces of <hi>Serum</hi> of Blood being added to a fourth Part of Raiſins of the Sun ſtoned, and kept in a Glaſs, in a warm Room for ſeveral days; the event of this tryal was, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:59609:844"/>in a few Days the Raiſins began to emerge, and whilſt they floated, yielded a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable quantity of ſpringy and permanent Air; from whence it appeared, that there had been ſome Degree of Fermentation. But when this <hi>Serum</hi> came to be diſtilled, tho' it did not ſtink as if it had been putrified, yet the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which firſt aſcended, taſted not like a-Viſcous Spirit, nor like a meer Phlegm. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Fermentation obſerved in this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, depended on the whole <hi>Serum,</hi> or on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the <hi>Aqueous</hi> Parts diſtinct from it, I ſhall leave to Experience to determine.</p>
                           <p>To try whether Digeſtion or Putrefaction would ſo open the Texture of Blood, as to make it part with its Spirit more eaſily, and before the Phlegm, I kept a quantity of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> for that purpoſe, four times as long as was ſufficient to make Urine part with its Spirit before its Phlegm, but the Liquor which came over by a gentle heat, had but little ſtrength either in Smell or Taſte; nor would it readily turn Syrup of Violets Green; yet like a Volatile <hi>Alkaly,</hi> it would ſoon turn a Solution of Sublimate in fair Water, into a White, Opacous, and almoſt Milky Liquor.</p>

                           <p>FOR ſeveral Reaſons I am inclined to believe, that the Spirit of Human Blood is totally compoſed of a Volatile Salt, and a Phlegm which is not ſo pure and Elementary, but that ſome Particles of Oyl, and others of Salt, may be mixed with it; and whether by frequent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifications this Phlegm may be rendered <hi>Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous</hi> I much queſtion, ſince I am not ſure, but that in frequent Diſtillations, ſome Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Fire mny be from time to time aſſociated with the Liquor; and even in the firſt Diſtillation, the Fire uniting with the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, may form one different from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients or Principles of the Body; and I have found that Woods afford by diſtillation, a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor which is not an Oyl, nor an Acid, or an Alkaly, and yet no true Phlegm, but an <hi>Adia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorous</hi> Liquor. And on this occaſion to ſhew, That the Compoſition of a Body may as well be made known by inveſtigating the way of generating or producing it, as by that of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſing or reſolving it; I ſhall add, that having diſſolved as much Volatile Salt of Human Blood in diſtilled Water, as the Liquor would take up, and then having diſtilled it in a convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhaped Veſſel, with a regulated degree of Heat, the Diſtillation afforded us ſuch a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:59609:845"/>as was deſired, ſince by Smell and Taſte it appeared to be a good brisk Spirit of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Blood. And this Experiment was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain repeated with the like ſucceſs.</p>

                           <p>THO' it be generally allowed that Saline Spirits are of two ſorts, yet it may not be amiſs to add, That ſome of them are Acid in Taſte, as Spirit of Nitre, Vitriol, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are rather like common or lixiviate Salts; and their different Effects and Operations are much leſs alike than their Taſte, for upon their mixture, there enſues a manifeſt conflict, and uſually one will precipitate the Bodies, the other will diſſolve. And amongſt Salts call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Alkalies,</hi> ſome are fixed in conſiderable Degrees of Fire, and others, who take <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Alkalies</hi> for the true Principles of mixed Bodies, call the one Fixed, and the other Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile <hi>Alkalies.</hi> And tho' I, who queſtion this Doctrine, often call the Salts made by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion, ſimply <hi>Alkalies,</hi> or lixiviate Salts, and thoſe that aſcend, ſometimes <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rinous,</hi> and ſometimes Volatile Salts, yet ſince the Names of Fixed <hi>Alkalies</hi> and Volatile ones are in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt now, I ſhall now make uſe of them in that Senſe.</p>
                           <pb n="489" facs="tcp:59609:845"/>
                           <p>Theſe Things being premiſed, I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to obſerve, that notwithſtanding that ſome Phyſicians and Chymiſts aſcribe Digeſtion to an Acid Ferment in the Stomach, yet the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Human Blood is referrable to that Claſſis, which many call Volatile <hi>Alkalies,</hi> ſince it ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally performs what Volatile <hi>Alkalies</hi> are ſaid to do; for it will ferment with Acids, turn Syrup of Violets Green, and precipitate a Solution of Sublimate in common Water.</p>
                           <p>Were I ſure that the Ferment of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach were Acid, I ſhould be apt to believe, that the Blood retains ſomething of Acidity in it; but yet that would not be an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment why I ſhould not refer the Spirit of Human Blood to the Claſs of <hi>Alkalies,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſo few Acid Particles would either be deſtroyed by the <hi>Alkalizate</hi> ones, that are ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant in the Spirit, or at leaſt they would be ſo very much predominant as to give us Reaſon on their account to denominate, the Mixture <hi>Alkalious.</hi> As if ſome drops of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Vinegar were mixed with ſtale Urine, they would be either depriv'd of their Acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by ſome Particles of a contrary Nature, or be ſo overpowered by the Fugitive Salts they abound with, that the Mixture might well be referred to the Claſſis of Volatile U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinous Salts.</p>

                           <p>UPON this Occaſion I ſhall offer, that not to intimate that a Body may have many ſimilar Qualities, in reſpect of another Body, and yet diſtinct Operations on a third Subſtance: I ſay, not to intimate that, there may be a conſiderable difference betwixt Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Salts or Spirits, as they are commonly prepared, and when prepared as they may, by reiterated Rectifications, and other ways of Depuration by a dextrous Chymiſt, to bring them to a greater degree of Purity and Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; a greater degree I ſay, becauſe it may be difficult to bring them to an abſolute Purity, ſince unheeded commixtures may be made, upon the Account of ſome Corpuſcles of Fire with the Body they work upon.</p>
                           <p>And that there is a manifeſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Spirit of Human Blood and other <hi>Alkalies,</hi> as Spirit of Urine and Harts-horn, is evident to ſeveral People who, tho' they abhor the Odour of Spirit of Blood, yet they will with Pleaſure hold their Noſes a great while over Spirit of Urine and <hi>Sal-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack.</hi> And tho' from a due proportion of Spirit of Urine or <hi>Sal-Armoniack</hi> with Spirit of Salt, I have got a Salt which ſhoots into the ſhape of that of Urine or <hi>Sal-Armoniack</hi>
                              <pb n="491" facs="tcp:59609:846"/>yet I have ſeldom, if ever, obtained a Salt of the like ſhape from a Mixture of the Spirit of Humane Blood with that of Common Salt, for tho upon an Evaporation of the ſuperfluous Moiſture, the Salts would coagulate together, yet the Concretion ſeemed confuſed, and not of the Regular ſhapes of thoſe Salts, reſulting from a Mixture of the Spirit of Sea-Salt with Urinous Spirits.

                           <p>As for the Degree of the Fluidity of the Blood, or its immunity from Tenaciouſneſs, tho' divers other Alkalizated Liquors, as <hi>Oyl of Tartar per deliquium, fixed Nitre</hi> reſolved <hi>per deliquium,</hi> a Solution of Pot-Aſhes, are ſenſibly <hi>unctuous,</hi> and but languidly fluid, yet I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that Spirit of Human Blood did not appear more Unctuous than common Water.
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:59609:847"/>And whereas it is commonly found, That as Liquors are more ſpirituous, ſo the Bubles raiſed by Agitation, ſooneſt diſappear; I have obſerved that the Spirit of Blood was almoſt as ſoon clear of them as Spirit of Wine; and when ſome Drops of it were let fall, they manifeſtly appeared leſs than Drops of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                           <p>To diſcover the ſubtlety of the Parts of Human Blood, we ſo prepared common Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by Infuſions made in it without Heat, that by putting one ſingle Drop of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified Spirit of Human Blood into ten Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and four Scruples of the prepared Water, and lightly ſhaking the Viol, there appeared throughout the Liquor a manifeſt Colour, whereof no Degree was diſcernible before; ſo that it diſperſed it ſelf through a thouſand times as much Water, and produced a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Change in the Colour of it: And tho' this Computation is made upon the common ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that a Drop of Water weighs a Grain, yet tho' it weighs more a little, the Difference is recompenſed, ſince having dropped ten Drops of common Water into a common Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance well adjuſted, and having likewiſe drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped ten Drops of this Spirit, we found that the laſt were not only leſs in bulk, but lighter, ſince they weighed not above four Grains, ſo that the Proportion to which it extended it ſelf, may be ſaid to be as one, to betwixt 4000 and 5000; and this ſubtlety of the Parts of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Human Blood will appear to be yet much greater, if we conſider, that ſome Part even of this Drop muſt needs be Phlegm.</p>

This Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Verdigreaſe being mixed in the ſmall Cylindrical Glaſs, with Spirit of Blood mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately ſtrong, not only produced a hiſſing Noiſe and ſtore of Bubbles, but an actual Heat, upon which the Liquor in the Thermoſcope
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:59609:848"/>aſcended above an Inch and a half, tho' both the Liquors employed amounted not to above two ſpoonfuls.</p>

                           <p>THAT this Spirit is not only a good Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine for ſeveral Diſeaſes, but is alſo a good <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> will appear from the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing inſtances. And firſt, having poured Spirit of Human Blood upon Crude Copper, in about a quarter of an hour the Liquor was tinged blueiſh, which colour grew higher and higher, till in ſome hours it was deeply Cerule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. And to this I ſhall add, that having drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped a drop or two of Spirit of Blood upon a piece of bright Copper, within about half a minute of an hour, the Verge of the moiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed part of the Surface appeared blueiſh, and in a little time after, the reſt of the wetted Part acquired a fine Azure.</p>
                           <p>Having poured Spirit of Blood upon filings of <hi>Zinke</hi> or Spiltre, it preſently began to work manifeſtly in the cold; and when aſſiſted by a little Heat, it diſſolved the <hi>Zinke</hi> briskly, and not without producing ſtore of bubbles, being alſo a little diſcoloured by the operation of this Experiment.</p>
                           <p>Having put a piece of clotted Blood, which had been expoſed to the Air, into a ſlender
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:59609:849"/>Vial of clear Glaſs, and then poured on a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle rectified Spirit of Human Blood, and ſhook the Glaſs a little, the blackneſs of the ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial part of the Blood preſently diſappeared, and became a florid Scarlet, and the Liquor was tinged with a fairer red, and from a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of bubbles paſſing from time to time out of the cold into it, ſeemed to work ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like a <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> but in a little time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Blood was degenerated from its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer colour to a little more dark one. But another clot of Blood, one ſide of which was red and the other black, being put into the Vial, and Spirit of Blood poured upon it, the red ſide had its colour improved, but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther continued black and dirty. And I once pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved twelve drachms of Blood in two of the Spirit of Blood, and found that twelve months after it remained fair and florid, and little leſs than totally fluid; and when the Veſſel was opened there appeared little ſign of Putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but only a ſmall clot was faſtened to the bottom, the reſt paſſing readily through a ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; ſo that the Spirit ſeemed to have a great embalming Virtue, ſince it was able to preſerve ſix times its weight of a Body ſo apt to putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie: But to what hath been obſerved, I ſhall add, that having comitted the Mixture to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation, the firſt Liquor was a kind of Phlegm, which was ſucceeded by a Spirituous Liquor and Volatile Salt in a dry form.</p>
                           <p>Having poured ſome of our Spirit upon filings of Iron, where they were not in the leaſt Ruſty, and kept them together a while in digeſtion, we found, as we expected, that that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:59609:849"/>by working upon them had produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a light ſubſtance, ſomething paler than a <hi>Crocus,</hi> and there appeared likewiſe in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor good ſtore of thin Plates, which after a gentle Agitation, being held againſt the Sun-Beams, exhibited the colours of the Rain-Bow very vividly; but the taſte of the Liquor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not at all Martial.</p>

                           <p>SPirit of Blood being put upon Saffron pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently acquired a yellow colour; and from Tu merick, a Tincture like a ſolution of Gold, which may doubtleſs prove a good Medicine in the Jaundice; and ſome of this Spirit being put upon powder of Blood, it preſently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from it a colour as red as that of <hi>French</hi> Claret, but when I made uſe of another parcel of Spirit well rectified, I found that it extracted not a Tincture ſo ſoon; and after ſeveral hours the colour it obtained was brown, which in ſome hours after was heightned into redneſs, and in a longer time it became al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as red as the former Tincture.</p>
                           <p>To ſhew that Spirit of Human Blood may extract Tinctures out of the hardeſt Bodies, we put filings with it into a ſmall Egg, and kept them all night in digeſtion in a moderate Heat; and the next day we found the Liquor
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:59609:850"/>tinged with a deep browniſh red; and thoſe filings which ſtuck to the ſides of the Veſſel and were above the Liquor, were turned by the Exhalations of this Spirit into a yellow <hi>Crocus:</hi> But the Mixture being kept ſome days longer in the ſame Veſſel, the colour of it was grown Opacous, and appeared to be black when it was looked upon in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable bulk; but it ſeemed of another colour when looked upon as it was ſpread thin upon white Paper. Some of this Ticture being pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon an infuſion of Galls, it would not make it of an Inky colour, nor was the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate, which preſently fell to the bottom, of an Inky colour. From which Experiments it appears, that it is unſafe either to ſuppoſe, that if Chalybeates be diſſolved in the Body, it muſt be by ſome Acid Juice, or to conclude, that if Steel be diſſolved by the Liquors of our Bodies, they muſt be <hi>ex predominio</hi> Alkali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zate, ſince a Liquor that is very different from Acids diſſolves it; but without touching fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon this account, I ſhall rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to the conſideration of Phyſicians, to pitch upon ſome other method of explicating the effects of Chalybeates upon Human Bodies, and whether martial Medicines may not be made uſe of, which are prepared by Volatite Alkalies, inſtead of Acids.</p>
                           <p>Spirit of Human Blood being kept in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion with powder of Amber, it extracted no conſiderable Tincture, but whether the fault was in the fineneſs of the Amber, or the weakneſs of the Spirit, I ſhall leave undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>

                           <p>IT hath a power of Precipitating, as other Volatile Spirits, moſt Bodies diſſolved in Acid <hi>Menſtruums;</hi> I ſay moſt, becauſe there is no need this rule ſhould be general, or hold when the Body is of ſuch a Nature, that it may be as well diſſolved by an Acid as an Alkaly; and that there are ſuch Bodies appears, ſince Spirit of Human Blood will diſſolve both Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and <hi>Zink,</hi> which may be likewiſe diſſolved by <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> and other Acid <hi>Menſtruums.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But that this Spirit will precipitate other Bodies diſſolved in Acid <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by ſeveral tryals made on red Lead diſſolved in Vinegar, Silver in <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> Gold in <hi>Aqua Regia,</hi> and Tin diſſolved in an appropriated <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and ſeveral other Bodies. And out of a Solution of common Salt made in Water, we could readily precipitate with the Spirit of Blood, a Subſtance which looked like a white Earth, and ſuch a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance I obtained in a far greater quantity, from that which the Salt-makers call <hi>Bittern,</hi> which uſually remains in their Salt Pans, when they have taken out about as much Salt, as would coagulate in figured grains.

                           <p>THAT there is an Affinity betwixt Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Human Blood, and Spirit of Wine, appears, ſince we have formerly obſerved that being put together, they will concoagulate, and continue united a long time; and tho' a rectified Spirit of Wine will not draw a Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture from Blood, yet Spirit of Blood will. But as for Lixiviate Liquors ſuch as are made of Salt of Tartar, fixed Nitre, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we find not that they will ſtrictly aſſociate with it. Spirit of Blood readily mixes with that Adia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorous Spirit formerly mentioned; but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlegmed Spirit of Blood mixed by agitation with its Oyl, will preſently ſeparate again, tho' with Spirit of Wine it will permanently unite, tho theſe two Liquors belong to a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, <hi>viz.</hi> the one to the Animal, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Vegetable Kingdom.</p>
                           <p>With the eſſential Oyls of Aromatick Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, the Spirit ſeems to have a greater Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; for an equal proportion of this Liquor, and of Oyl of Aniſeeds, drawn in an Alembick <hi>per Veſicam,</hi> being ſhaken together, they made a ſoft or Semifluid coagulation, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in that form for a day or two; and would probably have longer done ſo, if I
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:59609:852"/>had not had occaſion to proceed further with it.</p>
                           <p>To ſhew that Spirit of Human Blood may either communicate ſome of its ſaline Parts to eſſential Oyls, or work a change in them; I digeſted a while in a Glaſs with a long neck ſome recſtified Spirit of Human Blood, with a convenient quantity of Oyl of Aniſeeds drawn in an Alembick, and found that the Oyl grew coloured of a high yellow, and afterwards attained a high redneſs; which may afford us a hint of the cauſe of ſome changes of colour, that are produced in the Liquors of the Body.</p>
                           <p>To take off the ſtinking quality of Human Blood, and to render it more grateful, we mixed with it in a Glaſs about an equal quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity or half as much Oyl of Aniſeeds, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhaken them together in the Glaſs, we placed it in a Furnace with a gentle Heat, by which means the ſlight Texture of the <hi>Coagulum</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſſolved, part of the Oyl appeared float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the top, whence being ſeparated by a Tunnel, the Liquor was whitiſh and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſtinking ſmell; it ſmelling and taſteing ſtrong of Aniſeeds, tho' the ſaline Particles retained a conſiderable degree of their brisk and penetrating taſte.</p>
                           <p>Another way I took to deprive Spirit of Human Blood of its offenſive ſmell was, by employing a <hi>Medium</hi> to unite it with eſſential Oyls; for having diſſolved an eighth part of Oyl of Aniſeeds in highly rectified Spirit of Wine, and added an equal quantity of Spirit of Human Blood, and upon a convenient agitation we ſuffered the Mixture to ſettle a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:59609:852"/>time, after that it appeared, that ſome of the Oyl ſwam in drops diſtinct from the other Liquors, which conſiſted of a Mixture of the two Spirits impregnated with a few particles of Oyl which they had detained. This Liquor abounded with little Concretions made by the Coagulation of the Sanguineous and Vinous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; which by a gentle Heat were ſublimed in the form of a Volatile Salt, to the upper Part of the Glaſs; and this Salt had not only a much leſs penetrating Odour, than the meer Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Salt of Human Blood, but had quite loſt its ſtink, and yet retained a conſiderable quickneſs, and ſomething of the ſcent of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeds; and the remaining Liquor was likewiſe deprived of its ill ſmell, and moderately im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bued with that of the Oyl.</p>
                           <p>To try whether there would be any Affinity between our Spirit, and the highly rectified Oyl of <hi>Petroleum,</hi> I ſhaked a convenient quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of them together in a new Vial, upon which they preſently turned into a white Mixture; and tho' after a few hours the greater part of the Oyl ſwam above the Spirit, yet there appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two Liquors a good quantity of whiteiſh Matter, which ſeemed to be produced by the Union of many Particles of the Spirit and Oyl, which were moſt diſpoſed to combine.</p>

                           <p>TO try whether the Air will have any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable effect on the Spirit of Human Blood after Diſtillation, as it evidently hath on the Blood before, I ſpread thinly upon a piece of white Paper ſome ſmall filings of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and wetting them well without covering them quite over, with a few drops of Blood; by that means they being well expoſed to the free Air; the Action of the Liquor was ſo much promoted, that within a minute or two it did even in the cold acquire a blueiſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; and in fewer minutes than one would have expected, that colour was ſo heightned as to become Ceruleous; but another parcel of the ſame filings being put into a Vial, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe of the Air being excluded, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor would not in ſome hours acquire ſo deep a colour.</p>
                           <p>Having in a clear Cylindrical Vial of about an Inch Diameter, put more filings of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per than was requiſite to cover the bottom, and poured ſo much Spirit of Blood upon them as rought about a fingers breadth above them, it in a few hours acquired a rich colour, which after a day or two began to grow more faint, and afterwards gradually declined, till it was almoſt loſt; yet the Liquor was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together limpid or colourleſs, as I have often
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:59609:853"/>had it with Spirit of Urine or <hi>Sal-Armoniack,</hi> and theſe remains of blueiſhneſs I attributed to the effects of the Air included in the Bottle, with ſo ſmall a quantity of Liquor. And tho' I thought it not impoſſible, but that length of time might deſtroy it's blueiſhneſs, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopping the Veſſel, I obſerved, that in two minutes of an hour, the Surface of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor where it touched the freſh Air became Ceruleous; and in a quarter of an hour the whole Body of the Liquor had attained a deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er colour than that of the sky, which colour grew ſenſibly paler again when the Vial was ſtopped: But one thing I muſt add is, that I have found the Experiment to ſucceed with ſome Analogy, when another Volatile Spirit hath been made uſe of, in which there was no Volatile Salt of Human Blood; but the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment being repeated the Air produced a green and not a Ceruleous colour, which makes me ſuſpend my Judgment till ſatisfied by further experience, whether the event of the former tryal depended on any Affinity of the Spirit with Blood or not. And here I ſhall add, that a parcel of Spirit of Human Blood being kept in <hi>Vacuo Byliano,</hi> when the Air was pumpt out, it afforded fewer and leſs bubbles than an equal quantity of common Water.</p>

But there is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an Hoſtility evident betwixt the Parts of theſe Liquors, but alſo their <hi>Effluvia;</hi> for if Spirit of Salt of Nitre be put into a Vial ſomewhat wide mouthed, and Spirit of Blood rectified into another, when theſe Liquors are held near one another, their inviſible Emanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons joyning together will form a manifeſt Smoak.</p>
                           <p>Some pure Volatile Salt of Human Blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſt ſatiated with Spirit of Nitre, we ſlowly evaporated the ſuperfluous moiſture, which being done, we took the compound Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals which the Mixture afforded, and put it into a Bolt-Head with a ſlender and a long neck, and then adding to it a convenient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Salt of Tartar, and as much diſtilled Water as made the Mixture Liquid enough, the Salt of Tartar detained the Spirit of Nitre, and a good proportion of the Volatile Salt
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:59609:854"/>aſcended in a dry form to the neck of the Veſſel.</p>
                           <p>Spirit of Blood and Nitre being mixed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, there enſued a conflict, in which thick white fumes roſe plentifully, and circulating in the Veſſel, ran down the ſides of it in a white ſtream; untill the fumes ceaſed to riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the Mixture in the mean time appearing reddiſh.

                           <p>Some of the before mentioned Cryſtals being put upon well kindled Charcoal, preſently melted and burnt away like Salt-Petre, but the flame ſeemed not ſo halituous, and differed in colour, being not at all blue but yellow; and after the Deflagration ceaſed, there remained upon the Coal a lump of dirty coloured matter, which had ſcarce any taſte, nor was that little it had Alkalious. This brittle Subſtance being held in the flame, became red hot without any ſenſible imminution, and ſo it did upon a live Coal.</p>

And for a like purpoſe, to bring over the Saline Part of Blood in a liquid form, we mixed two Parts of dryed Blood with three of Spirit of Blood, and diſtilling them with a pretty ſtrong fire, we obtained a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty deal of Spirit, unaccompanyed with any Volatile Salt, in a dry form; and this Spirit ſeemed to have a ſtronger taſte and ſmell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rectification, than Spirit of Human Blood prepared another way had after rectification;
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:59609:855"/>and had we made uſe of more Lime, I queſtion not but that we ſhould have obtained a more piercing Spirit, ſince it would have retained more of the Oyl and the ſuperfluous moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture.</p>
                           <p>And on this occaſion I ſhall add, that I have often found Head-aches cured by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated application of Spirit of Human Blood; which is likewiſe good in Hyſterick and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriacal Caſes, and in fainting Fits; and if the ſmell of it makes it too nauſeous, that may be corrected according to the method already laid down in this Chapter, to which I ſhall add, that a few drops of Oyl of <hi>Rhodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> being diſſolved in Alcohol of Wine, if that be mixed with Spirit of Human Blood, it will give it a very grateful and odoriferous ſmell.</p>
                           <p>And here I ſhall add, that Medicines made of Amber have been found ſucceſsful not only in Convulſions, and other Diſtempers of the <hi>Genus Nervoſum,</hi> but the Tincture of it in Spirit of Wine, hath proved ſucceſsful enough in Diſeaſes both of Men and Women. And this Tincture may not inconveniently or unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully be added, to correct the Odour and increaſe the Virtues of Spirit of Human Blood; and tho Oyl of Amber will not mix readily with Spirit of Wine, yet if they be ſhaken to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and left to ſettle at leiſure, tho' they ſettle in diſtinct maſſes, yet the Spirit would even in the cold extract a high and a yellow Tincture, little different from the Oyl it ſelf, which may be mixed with the Spirit of Blood, till the ſmell of the Amber be predominant.</p>
                           <pb n="510" facs="tcp:59609:856"/>
                           <p>To what hath been ſaid of the external uſe of Spirit of Human Blood I ſhall add, that if the Oyl in theſe Mixtures ſhould be too much predominant, it may be eaſily ſeparated by runing it through a Tunnel, whoſe Orifice at the bottom is formed ſo ſmall and ſharp, as to give way for the Spirit to run off firſt, which may when thus ſeparated be kept in a diſtinct Veſſel. And ſince if the Vinous Spirit be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently rectified, there will by the Coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Saline and Urinous Parts, be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a kind of Salt, you may either pour the Liquid part into another Veſſel, and then uſe them ſeparate, or elſe ſeparate the Salt by ſublimation in a dry form; and Spirit of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Blood thus ſeparated will have a fragrant brisk and piercing Odour. But,</p>
                           <p>To conclude, this Spirit is not only good in reſpect of the Virtues aſcribed to its ſcent, but it may be good likwiſe when uſed as a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, as Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniack</hi> hath been effectual in removing the Pains of the Gout, and in the Eriſipelas. And ſince upon the account of its Alkalizate Nature it may be good to correct Acidities, it may be for that purpoſe made uſe of both by Phyſicians and Chirurgeons.</p>

                           <p>I Have been long apt to think, that the ſame peccant matter may produce ſeveral Diſtempers as its effects are diverſified, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by its greater or leſſer quantities, as well as more or leſs active qualities, and partly by the particular Natures, or Structures, and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuations of the Parts that it invades; which ſeems to be favoured by the frequent <hi>Metaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> of Morbifick matter in ſeveral Diſtempers, ſince the ſame Acid or ſharp Humours ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times occaſion a Colick, ſometimes after that a Palſey, at other times a Cough, a flux of the Belly, an Opthalmia, a Violent Head-ach, Convulſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As the peccant Humour falls upon this or that part, upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count one or two Medicines may be able to cure ſeveral Diſtempers, eſpecially if endew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any variety of active Virtues; and upon theſe grounds I am inclined to believe, that the Spirit of Human Blood may be a good Remedy in ſeveral internal affections of the Body; and indeed Volatile Alkalies in general have been ſo proſperouſly made uſe of in Phyſick, ſince the year 1656 as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite ſeveral Phyſicians to employ them inſtead of other Medicines, which clog and weaken the Patient, and want ſeveral advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:59609:857"/>qualities, which may be found in Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Alkalies.</p>
                           <p>And indeed Spirit of Human Blood mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies Acid Salts, which occaſion ſeveral Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes: It is likewiſe a great Reſolvent, and fit to open Obſtructions which produce not a few Diſeaſes; it is alſo Diaphoretick and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uretick, and able to diſcharge ſeveral noxious Salts, and to expel ſeveral Malignant and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious Particles of matter. It reſiſts Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and Coagulation; and gives a brisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Spirituouſneſs to the Blood, which promotes free Circulation, upon which account it is a good Cordial and an Antidote againſt ſome Poyſons: It is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry friendly to the <hi>Genus Nervoſum,</hi> and to cure its Diſtempers, and Balſamick in ſome ſort of <hi>Aſthams,</hi> it neither cauſes great eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations, nor does it clog the Stomach; or is diſadvantageous in any manifeſt qualities. And it may likwiſe be very good in ſuch caſes as Spirit of <hi>Sal-Armoniack</hi> hath been found ſucceſsful in. <hi>Helmont</hi> commends it in Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepſies, which he ſays, it will cure in Adult Perſons: And I have known it cure an inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Conſumptive Cough, and a very bad Head-ach, which had a long time baffled ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eminent Phyſicians. But beſides the Virtues it hath when ſimply uſed, its Virtues may be enobled and diverſified by a long digeſtion, or frequent Cohobations of the Spirit with the Oyls, Salt or Phlegm of the ſame Concrete; or, by uniting it with Acids, as Spirit of Nitre, or Vinegar; Verdigreaſe, Oyl of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:59609:857"/>
                              <hi>&amp;c.</hi> either uſed in a Liquid form, or when reduced by evaporation into Cryſtals.</p>
                           <p>Or the Virtues of it may be enobled, by u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting our Spirit with Metalline Solutions, as of Gold, Silver, or Mercury; and with Solutions of <hi>Minium</hi> made with Spirit of Vinegar; by a Mixture of which Liquor and a ſlow evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, I have obtained finely ſhaped Cryſtals.</p>
                           <p>Or, again either by uniting with it Sulphur opened with Salt of Tartar; or by diſſolving in it Metalline Bodies, as Copper, <hi>Zinke,</hi> and Iron. Or by adding about a double weight of Alcohol of Wine; for theſe Liquors being ſhaken together, will in a very great meaſure coagulate into a Salt, which will retain a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable degree of quickneſs and penetrancy. And why ſuch Salts as theſe ſhould not be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious I ſee no reaſon, ſince ſuch a kind of a Mixture, tho' made with another Urinous Spirit hath had extraordinary effects in Fevers. nor is the Liquor this Salt leaves behind uſeleſs in Medicine when well dephlegmed.</p>
                           <p>But this Spirit may be rendered ſtill more commodious, if impregnated with eſſential Oyls; and by that means ſeveral Oyly Volatile Salts may be produced, which may be uſeful in peculiar Diſtempers, as thoſe Oyls reſpect this or that part in their Medicinal Virtues.</p>

                        <p>HAving cauſed twelve Ounces of dryed Blood to be carefully diſtilled, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances obtained from it, were of Volatile Salt and Spirit together five Ounces; the Liquor poured off from the wet Salt being thirteen Drachms, fifty four Grains, ſo that the Salt was three Ounces, two Drachms, and ſix Grains; of fetid Oyl there were two Ounces; of <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> four Ounces, and two Drachms; ſo that about ſix Drachms of the whole was conſumed in the Operation. The <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> being calcined yielded but ſix Drachms and a half of aſhes, the fixed Olea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous Parts being conſumed by the accenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the colour of the aſhes was reddiſh when cool, tho' in the fire they appeared white as ſoon as the Oyl was conſumed, theſe aſhes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing turned into a <hi>Lixivium,</hi> afforded five ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of white fixed Salt, beſides a little which got into the contiguous Sand, which being recovered by Water, and reduced to a Salt made a ſcruple more.

<pb n="515" facs="tcp:59609:858"/>the weight of the Salt; whence it appears, that the pure fixed Salt is but between the fifty ſeventh and fifty eighth part of dryed Blood, and therefore probably amounts to no more than about the 170th part of the maſs of Blood; and the fixed Earth is to dryed Blood as about nineteen and about a half to one.</p>

                           <p>To try whether <hi>Serum</hi> as well as Urine, might not as well be made uſe of for inviſible Ink, we traced ſome Characters with it upon white Paper; and when they were dryed, we held the unwritten ſide over the flame of a Candle, keeping it always ſtirring, that it might not take fire, upon which the Letters on the upper ſide appeared of a dark colour, tho' not of an Inky blackneſs.</p>

                        <p>SINCE according to the ſeveral ways of diſtilling Human Blood, the Spirit of Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> produced, may be conſiderably di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſified; I diſtilled three Portions of Human Blood, each with a different additament.</p>
                        <p>The firſt which was diſtilled with Quick-Lime, we ſhall ſubjoyn the following account of, <hi>viz.</hi> Four Ounces of coagulated Blood, being mixed with an equal proportion of Quick-Lime, we diſtilled them by degrees of fire in a Retort placed in Sand, by which means we obtained a proportion of reddiſh Spirituous Liquor, which ſeemed not very Phlegmatick, together with ſome Oyl, the quantity of which was but ſmall, the reſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing probably detained by the Lime, and a ſmall Portion of that little Oyl that came
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:59609:862"/>over ſunk in the Spirit, the reſt ſwiming up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. The Spirit being ſet in a digeſtive Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace in a ſmall Head and Body, to rectifie with a gentle Heat, the Receiver was three or four times removed; and we obſerved, that the firſt Spirit that came over was not near ſo fetid, as that which aſcends when it is diſtilled <hi>per ſe;</hi> and the like was obſerved in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Portions, the Oyl being detained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind by the Quick-Lime; the rectified Spirit was clear and colourleſs, and had a taſte much ſtronger than its ſmell, and ſo ſtrong that it made me think ſome Volatile Alkalious Parts of the Quick-Lime were carried up with it, to be ſatisfied of which we dropped ſome of it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Solution of Sublimate with fair Water; and on the firſt contact we perceived a precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate a little inclining to yellow, as Quick-Lime in a greater quantity uſually turned it: But afterwards the Precipitate appeared white, like that made with ordinary Volatile Liquors of an Urinous Nature.</p>
                        <p>Some of this Spirit put into a Glaſs-Egg, afforded not any Volatile Salt in a dry form, and the tryal being continued, we found, that the Spirit by the action of the fire loſt its limpidneſs, and became muddy or troubled.</p>
                        <p>Another Portion of it being mixed with a highly rectified ardent Spirit, upon their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept all Night in the cold, no coagulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on enſued, nor could we perceive any, when it had been kept ſeveral hours in a moderate Heat. But the Mixture acquired a yellow colour, and let fall a pretty deal of darkiſh powder.</p>
                        <pb n="523" facs="tcp:59609:862"/>
                        <p>Some of this Spirit being mixed with good Spirit of Salt, they ſmoaked at their firſt meeting, but produced neither bubbles or noiſe.</p>
                        <p>Another Portion being mixed with Oyl of Vitriol, there was produced a great ſmoak, and an intenſe degree of Heat without any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Ebullition, or any bubbles or noiſe, but the colour of the Oyl was heightned and grew almoſt red.</p>
                        <p>From whence it appears, that this Alkali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zated Spirit of Blood is very different from ſimple Spirit of Blood; but whether upon this account it becomes a more violent, or a leſs ſafe Medicine, further Experience muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover.</p>

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Of ſpecifick Medicines.</note>BEfore I deſcend to ſhew that the notion of Specifick Medicines is agreeable to ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick Medicines, I ſhall firſt repreſent, that I am induced to believe that there are ſuch, by
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:59609:865"/>the common Obſervations of a great many learned Men and able Phyſicians; and to favour this common Obſervation, <hi>viz.</hi> That there are ſuch Subſtances which have peculiar effects, which can be aſcribed to no manifeſt Qualities, I ſhall urge the effects of Poyſons taken in a very inconſiderable quantity. And I am told, that ſomething that fell from a Spider into a Man's Eye cauſed him to loſe his ſight, to which I ſhall add, that Spiders are obſerved to kill flies, much ſooner than cutting off their Heads, or running them through with Pins will do it. To which inſtances we may add, that moſt Poyſons are cured by appropriated Antidotes; and as perfumes cauſe ill ſymtoms in many Hiſterick Women, ſo the fumes of Feathers burnt relieve them. And I have found that the ſmell of Spirit of Harts-horn or <hi>Sal-Armoniack,</hi> hath recovered People made ſick by fragrant Odours. But beyond all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Arguments is experience; for <hi>Galen</hi> tells us, That the aſhes of a burnt Craw-Fiſh will cure the biting of a mad Dog, and that their effects are much more conſiderable, if to ten Parts of burnt Craw-Fiſh we add five of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian and one of Frankincenſe. And <hi>Diaſcorides</hi> commends them againſt the ſame Diſeaſe that the <hi>Pergamenian</hi> does. And tho' the ſtings of Scorpions uſually produce very acute Pains and formidable Symtoms, yet the miſchief is eaſily remedied, either by cruſhing the Body of the Scorpion upon the Hurt, or by anointing the Part with Oyl of Scorpions, tho' the Liquor appears not to have any ſenſible Qualities, to which their Efficacy may be aſcribed.</p>
                     <pb n="530" facs="tcp:59609:866"/>
                     <p>And to theſe Inſtances I might add, that <hi>Verginian</hi> Snake-weed cures the ſting of a rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Snake, and the Jeſuit's Powder is a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick in Agues. And tho' it be argued againſt the Virtues of ſpecifick Medicines, that they are altered by the ferment of the Stomach, and other ſtrainers of different Textures, and that a great deal is carried off by Excrements, or is aſſimilated and converted into the Subſtance of our Bodies; yet to theſe things it may be anſwered, that not only Oyntments, Plaiſters, <hi>Periapta, &amp;c.</hi> work upon the maſs of Humours; but even thoſe Medicines which are allowed to work by manifeſt Qualities, perform what they do upon the account of their Particles al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terering, and differently diſpoſing the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of our Bodies, and in doing of that they are liable to the ſame objections offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt ſpecifick Medicines. Beſides, it is obſervable that <hi>Rhubarb,</hi> will tinge the Urine of thoſe that take a conſiderable Doſe. And there is a Fruit called prickled Pears in the <hi>Engliſh American</hi> Colonies, which paſſes by Urine, ſo much unaltered, that the People think, when ſtrangers to it, that they piſs Blood. And <hi>Elaterium</hi> ſo much impregnates the Milk of a Nurſe, that it will Purge the Child that takes it. And I remember that in the confines of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Swizerland,</hi> when the Cattle fed on a Herb called wild Garlick, the butter would ſenſibly taſte of it. And in <hi>Ireland</hi> they have a kind of Sea-Fowl which feed upon Fiſhes, which is ſo little altered, as to make ſome queſtion whether it be Fleſh or Fiſh.</p>
                     <pb n="531" facs="tcp:59609:866"/>
                     <p>And tho' it be further urged againſt Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Medicines, that ſo little is diſperſed through the habit of the Body, that it can have no conſiderable effects; yet their Efficacy may anſwer for their ſmallneſs in quantity. For I am told that the <hi>Negroes</hi> have a Poyſon, which tho' it work ſlow, is nevertheleſs Mortal, and this they conceal under the Nails of their Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and drop into the Aliment of thoſe they have ſpite to. And I know a Vegetable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, half a Grain of which will be too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a Purgative; and ſometimes Mortal: And tho' <hi>Engliſh</hi> Vipers are looked upon as no Poyſon, yet by the Wound of a ſingle Tooth I knew one who was taken with violent Vomitings. To which may be added the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible effects of Scorpions in the Iſland of <hi>Java.</hi> And we ſee that ſeveral Women, otherwiſe ſtrong and luſty, will fall into Swoons upon the ſmell of Musk or Civet, tho' all the <hi>Effluvia</hi> that affect them, would not amount to the hundredth part of a Grain; and by <hi>Effluvia,</hi> perhaps not more plentiful theſe Symptoms may be again removed. And the Portions of <hi>Crocus Metallorum</hi> in Wine, or of Quick-Silver in Water, tho' ſmall have very conſiderable effects, ſo that when a Child who obſtinately refuſed all Medicines, drank ſmall Beer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with Mercury, he was much reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a violent worm Fever.</p>

                        <note place="margin">That their Operations may be Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanically ſolved, is proved in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note>Having ſaid thus much of ſpecifick Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, I ſhall now proceed to lay down ſome things in the following Propoſitions, to ſhew that they be mechanically explicated: But firſt I ſhall premiſe, that I would not have the

                     <p>This being premiſed there is no need to think, that all ſpecificks act after the ſame manner, or the ſame way, and ſometimes the ſpecifick may operate by a joynt and in a compound way. But to proceed to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Propoſitions.</p>

                           <hi>Menſtruums</hi> very different from one another, but their effects evidently appear not to depend upon manifeſt Qualities, ſince it ſeveral times happens that a <hi>Menſtruum</hi> leſs Acid, may diſſolve this or that Body, which a much ſtronger <hi>Menſtruum</hi> will not work upon; ſo Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will diſſolve the white of an Egg, which Spirit of Wine will coagulate, and ſo will Spirit of Salt and Oyl of Tartar it ſelf; and thus dephlegmed Spirit of Urine will more readily diſſolve filings of Copper than Spirit of Vitriol, and yet the latter will ſpeedily diſſolve Crabs Eyes, tho' the other leaves them untouched; ſo Quick-Silver will diſſolve Gold in the cold, tho' <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> aſſiſted by Heat leaves it untouched; yet <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> will diſſolve Iron, and Quick-ſilver will not. And Brimſtone will be diſſolved by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Oyl, tho' not by <hi>Aqua Fortis.</hi> And I know a Liquor of which one may ſafely drink a Wine Glaſs full, tho' it will have ſuch an effect upon Stones and Metals as can ſcarce be matched.</p>
                        <p>And if ſpecifick Medicines may act upon Humours in the Body, after the manner of <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> we may eaſily gueſs why they have peculiar Virtues, <hi>viz.</hi> By reaſon of their aptneſs to work upon peculiarly diſpoſed Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, ſo, as I have elſewhere noted, <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> will not work upon Silver if too ſtrong, till diluted with Water.</p>
                        <p>And as the diſſolution of a Body may part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depend in its diſpoſition, to be acted on by ſuch a <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> from thence may be
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:59609:868"/>deduced a reaſon, why a Medicine which hath good effects in one Diſeaſe may have but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different ones in others; for tho pure Spirit of Wine will eaſily diſſolve <hi>Gumm, Guajacum,</hi> and that Roſinous matter lodged in the Pores of the Wood, yet the ſame <hi>Menſtruum</hi> will not work upon the Wood it ſelf. And if ſo, no wonder that thoſe Medicines which cure one Diſtemper in one Perſon, will not cure it in another, ſince a Variation in the Texture of the Morbifick matter, is enough to vary the effects of the Medicines. And that a ſlight alteration of Texture varies the effects of a <hi>Menſtruum</hi> appears, ſince, tho' Spirit of Nitre or Salt ſeparate will each diſſolve Copper; and tho' the Spirit of Nitre will diſſolve Silver, yet if Spirit of Salt be added to it, it ſoon loſes that Quality.</p>
                        <p>And here, tho' ſome object againſt ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Medicines, that ſince they rove up and down in the Blood, they cannot act well on particular Humours, yet if we ſuppoſe the Medicines act by impregnating the Blood, and that they turn it into a kind of <hi>Menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> it is poſſible that both the <hi>Menſtruums</hi> may be appropriated to the peccant Humour, ſo as to reſolve it more eaſily than any other Humour of the Body. As if you take ſome Bone aſhes, <hi>Crocus Martis,</hi> Saw-duſt, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Sea-Salt, and filings of Gold, and mix them together, common Water will diſſolve the Salt and leave the others untouched, and Quick-Silver will alone diſſolve the Gold: And thoſe that work in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gold Mines
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:59609:868"/>tell us, that Quick-Silver poured upon pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Ore of Gold and Copper mixed, it will ſcarce meddle with the latter, till the former is licked up.</p>
                        <p>And from what hath been ſaid, we may be furniſhed with a reaſon of the effects of <hi>Periapta</hi> Amulets and <hi>Appenſa,</hi> eſpecially if we conſider what hath already been delivered of the <hi>Effluviums</hi> of Bodies, and the Poroſity of Animal Bodies; and tho' theſe <hi>Effluvia</hi> be very ſmall in quantity, yet their effects may be more conſiderable, in as much as they are neither altered nor conſumed, by previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous digeſtions, and circulating through Parts, in which they might be in a great meaſure diſperſed, and carried off a-long with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements.</p>

<pb n="536" facs="tcp:59609:869"/>their edges; as a Knife may loſe its power of cutting, by putting it in a ſheath, or ſticking ſomething upon the edge; for the edges of an Acid may be taken off, as well by being lodged in a Porous Alkaly, as by having their edges broken off; and thus it is that <hi>Minium</hi> takes off the Acidity of Vinegar; Chalk takes off the edge of <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> and <hi>Lapis Calaminaris</hi> leſſens the Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of Spirit of Salt and Spirit of Nitre; and that Acids are rather ſheathed than alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by theſe Bodies, I am apt to believe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as <hi>Glauber</hi> tells us, they may by a ſtrong fire be drawn out of <hi>Lapis Calaminaris</hi> much ſtronger and more dephlegmed than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                        <p>And tho' it may be urged by thoſe that plead againſt ſpecifick Medicines, that they act by a manifeſt Quality, <hi>viz.</hi> their Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Nature, or their Acid; yet there is ſo great a variety betwixt Acid and Alkalious Medicines themſelves, that I am perſwaded they perform a great deal upon the account of ſomething elſe, beſides their Acid or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalious Nature, ſince <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> will not diſſolve God tho' it will Silver, but if it be altered by an addition of Spirit of Salt, it will diſſolve Gold and not Silver. And a different Modification may not only make a difference betwixt Acids, but a contrariety; ſince Spirit of Salt will precipitate Silver, which <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> hath diſſolved: And Spirit of Nitre will precipitate out of Butter of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, an Antimonial powder with a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:59609:869"/>Conflict and Efferveſcence; yet this Butter of Antimony is ſo highly Acid, that a little quantity of it put into a little Water makes it ſo ſower, that many Chymiſts call it <hi>Acetum Philoſophorum.</hi> And as there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral kinds of Acids and of Alkalies too, ſo every Alkaly will not mortifie the ſame Acid; for tho' Chalk will precipitate a Solution of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> yet a Volatile Alkaly will not. And indeed when I conſider what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there naturally is betwixt Acids, it is not unreaſonable to expect, that there may be Acid Humours produced in the Body utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us, and which may require a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Alkaly to correct them, as it is obſerved, that tho' neither Spirit of Vinegar, nor Spirit of Salt, nor Oyl of Vitriol, will diſſolve a <hi>Calculus Humanus,</hi> yet Spirit of Nitre will, and by that means loſes its Corroſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                        <p>And to what hath been ſaid, I ſhall add, that I am of opinion that particular Acids may be the occaſion of Diſtempers, which they are by ſome rather taken to be Remedies; for tho' Acids are looked upon to be of an inciſive Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and tho' in ſome caſes I am willing to allow them thoſe Virtues; yet I believe that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and the Diſeaſes depending therein, are cauſed by Acids coagulating, ſome fluids diſpoſed to be thickned by them; which might be exemplified by the Coagulation I have made of ſome Acid Salts, as Spirit of Salt, of the white of an Egg, which by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beaten is reduced to an Aqueous conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence:
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:59609:870"/>And Milk will be coagulated not only by Spirit of Salt, but Rennet and Juice of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and it hath been found by experience, that ſome Acids tranſmitted into the maſs of Blood, have coagulated it in living Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.</p>
                        <p>But tho' I believe a great many Diſtempers are occaſioned by Acids, yet I conceive ſome are occaſioned by Acid Salts uniting with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Saline Bodies; as Spirit of Salt, and Spirit of Urine produce a <hi>Sal-Armoniack.</hi> And Spirit of Nitre with Salt of Tartar diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in common Water will coagulate with it into Salt-Petre; and the ſame Spirit of Nitre with Spirit of Urine will produce a very fuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Salt, different from either of the Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients; and Oyl of Vitriol or Oyl of Tartar <hi>per Deliquium</hi> will produce <hi>Tartarum Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olatum;</hi> in which both the Acidity and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaliouſneſs of the Ingredients are much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed, the Body reſulting from the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition being different from both the Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients: And if beſides theſe inſtances we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how many different Subſtances may be produced by Nature, I am apt to believe, that ſpecifick Qualities are requiſite to alter or deſtroy them, in the Medicines made uſe of for that purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>And to what hath been ſaid, I ſhall further add, that I have mixed two Liquors together neither of which were Acid or Alkalious, and yet the reſulting Body was a conſiſtent <hi>Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulum.</hi> And I have prepared a certain Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, which upon the affuſion of Spirit of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine

<pb n="540" facs="tcp:59609:871"/>or Forty Parts of Diſtill'd Water; for if clean Plates of Copper be immerſed in the Solution, the Metal will be ſlowly precipitated out of it, in the form, not of a <hi>Calx,</hi> but pure ſhining Scales of Silver; and if you rub Dantzick Vitriol upon the Blade of a Knife well wetted with Water, the Steel in a trice will be overlaid with a reddiſh ſubſtance, which by its Colour and Signs appears manifeſtly cupreous. And here I ſhall add, that there are in Nature, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitants which ſilently precipitate ſome Bodies diſſolved in Urinous <hi>Menſtruums.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p>But moreover it is poſſible Precipitations may be made in the maſs of Blood, without the Medicine getting into it, which is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the uſe of Chalybeat Medicines; where were it urged, that they paſs through the Pores of the Guts, then there is no reaſon why there are not Pores in the Body large enough to carry off the Precipitated Parts of the maſs of Blood.</p>

                        <p>And that Precipitating may be of uſe in Phyſick, I am the more inclined to believe, if a Putrefaction of Humours be rightly aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the cauſe of ſome Diſtempers; becauſe I know a Liquor which being dropped into ſtinking Water, Precipitated a light Feculen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy out of it, upon which the Liquor was wholly freed from its ſtink, nor could I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the Feculency it ſelf had any; and what was more remarkable was, that the taſte of this Precipitant was neither Bitter, Acid, Urinous or Lixiviate.</p>

                           <hi>PROP. IV.</hi> Sometimes the Specifick Remedy may work by peculiarly ſtrengthening and cheriſhing the Heart; the part affected, or both.</head>
                        <p>That a Medicine may have peculiar effects on this or that Part, I am inclined to believe for the following reaſons. Firſt, becauſe the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Parts of the Body are of different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly framed, and have different Humours lodged in them; and conſequently the Parts of a Medicine diſperſed through the Body, may be more aptly appropriated to be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or detained in thoſe Parts; and the Parts being thus ſtrengthened may be more able
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:59609:872"/>to reſiſt the influence of Morbifick Humours, by which means they are thrown upon more ignoble Parts, for which reaſon, ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are ſeiſed with the Gout; and I know a Gentleman, who tho' he could drink Wine without much hurt, yet Brandy would cauſe him to have a ſevere Tooth-ach.</p>
                        <p>But to illuſtrate what I was ſaying, of the diſpoſition of ſome Parts of Medicines to aſſociate themſelves with thoſe Parts they ſeem friendly to; I ſhall add, that in nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Children, Milk does not only afford groſſer <hi>Faeces,</hi> and various other Excrements as Urine, Mucous, and a Humour by inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Tranſpiration, but Particles which upon their being aſſimilated increaſe the bulk of the Body; and whereas it is obſerved, that ſome Cartilages in Children acquire a Bony hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in older Perſons, this change cannot be ſuppoſed to be the bare effect of Exſicca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>And as Specifick Medicines may confirm the ſtrength of a Part, ſo they may conduce to the reſtoreing of ſtrength to the weak Part, by removing Diſtempered Humours; and this they may do, not only by altering the whole maſs of Blood, but their peculiar diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to act on the Diſtempered Humour And as the Morbifick matter is diverſify'd, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording the diſpoſition of the part it is lodged in, ſo muſt the Medicine be Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fically appropriated. And as they contribute to the removal of a Diſtempered Humour, ſo conſequently they will to the ſtrengthening
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:59609:872"/>of the fibres of thoſe Parts; either by giving them a firmneſs; or by correcting their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate Heat or Cold; or correcting the Humours lodged in the Pores of the Part, or by takeing away the Convulſive or inordinate motions of the Parts; or by relaxing, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe altering their Pores, or cauſing the matter lodged there to be expelled by a gentle or violent agitation; as when <hi>Cantharides</hi> cauſe an Excretion of Urine, or Gravel, by irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating the fibres of the Bladder: And the effects of this Medicine alone are ſufficient to prove, that there may be Specifick Medicines which chiefly reſpect particular Parts; ſince <hi>Cantharides</hi> paſs through the Body, without affecting any other part but the Bladder.</p>
                        <p>And tho' at the firſt a Medicine may chiefly reſpect a particuler part, without altering the Blood, yet when once it hath cauſed a change in it, the Blood it ſelf, as it ſucceſſively circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates through that Part, may in ſome meaſure act Specifically upon it. And tho' a Medicine may communicate to the Blood Particles of matter ſo modified, that they may not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately relieve the Part, by either ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, or cauſing the Diſtempered matter to be carried off by a gentle irritation, yet it may do it by both theſe ways, as when Rhubarb is taken, it not only purges the Liver of Choler, but ſtrengthens the Tone of the Parts by its aſtringency. And <hi>Oſteocalla</hi> is obſerved to be a Specifick, by promoteing the Generation of a <hi>Callus,</hi> to cement broken Bones.</p>

                        <p>And this is agreeable enough with what moſt Moderns hold, <hi>viz.</hi> That Diſtempers chiefly depend upon the Temper and ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Humours. And a change in the Humours may be effected.</p>
                        <p>By furniſhing the Blood with ſome ſort of active Corpuſcles, which may agitate and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it, and to quicken the Circulation of the Blood. Upon which occaſion it may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to advertiſe, That the Medicines uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made uſe of for that purpoſe being very hot; there are ſeveral Conſtitutions of Patients, and ſeveral other Circucumſtances, upon which account they do more harm by their Heat, than good by their Spirituouſneſs; beſides the ſluggiſhneſs and want of fermentation in the Blood, may proceed from cauſes which this ſort of Medicine will not correct; for I have tryed, that a Vinous Spirit would not diſſolve Blood which was a little dryed, nor draw a Tincture from it, tho' an Urinous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit preſently did; ſo that a Specifick Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine in ſuch a caſe may perform what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, without the inconveniences which other
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:59609:873"/>Medicines are liable to: For we know that experienced Phyſicians, call ſome Medicines cold Cordials, as Sorrel, which hath an Acid taſte; and it is poſſible ſometimes thoſe Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours whch make the Blood ſluggiſh may not be of a cold, but a hot Nature, in which caſes hot Remedies may rather increaſe than diminiſh their ill effects; as if the white of an Egg be reduced to Water by beating, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine will inſtead of diminiſhing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe its Viſcidity. And I once prepared a Vegetable Subſtance, which upon an additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Wine became much more Viſcous than before.</p>
                        <p>But to proceed, a Specifick Medicine may alter the maſs of Blood, by contributing to its Tenacity, without reſpect to its Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; for if the Blood be too thick, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not readily paſs through the ſmall Capillary Veſſels, by which Circulation is in a great means retarded; as on the other Hand, if it be too thin, it gets out of the Capillary Veſſels, and firſt Stagnates, and then Putrifies; but theſe ill conſequences may be prevented, by ſuch Medicines as either on the one Hand divide the Parts of the Blood, and make them more minute, or on the other ſuch as aſſociate them, and ſtick them together.</p>
                        <p>Another way by which a Specifick Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine may rectifie the ſtate of the Blood, is, by working ſo upon the Heart, as to make it tranſmit Blood more advantageouſly; and that either by corroborating its fibres, or diſſolving ſome ill diſtempered matter, that
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:59609:874"/>obſtructs the Contraction of it; and that a ſmall alteration in the Conſtitution of the Heart, may do much in reſpect of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of the Blood, will be eaſily granted by any one, that does but conſider what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible Agents actuate it. And that the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt inſenſible Obſtruction of Circulation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces conſiderable effects in the Body is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, from the effects of Sorrow, which preſently puts the whole Body out of order; and alſo from the effects of Joy or ſhame, both of which promote the Circulation of the Blood; and it hath been obſerved, that Joy hath had ſo ſudden and conſiderable an effect, as to take off the ſharpneſs of Hunger; and that Medicines may affect the Heart after the ſame manner, I am inclined to believe; eſpecially ſince I knew a Lady, who was ſo affected upon the ſmell of perfumed Gloves, that the Blood flew into her Face, and put ſuch a colour into it as if ſhe had bluſhed. And if the ſtate of the Blood may be thus altered, it may much contribute to the removal of ſome very troubleſome Diſtemper, induced for want of a due Circulation of the Blood.</p>

And Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine mixed with rectified Spirit of Urine, will in a great meaſure take off the corroding Qualities of it, and compoſes a Salt which is weaker than the Spirit, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſublimed or reduced to a Liquor, becomes a good Medicine; and with a little skill will make a very good <hi>Menſtruum</hi> in ſeveral Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Experiments.</p>
                        <pb n="548" facs="tcp:59609:875"/>
                        <p>A few Grains of Glaſs of Antimony taken inwardly, will both Vomit and Purge, but if inſtead of Spirit of Wine we make uſe of that of Vinegar, and when by digeſtion the Liquor is ſufficiently impregnated, it be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted, Antimonial and Acetous Corpuſcles will emerge, ſeveral Grains of which may be taken without either Vomiting or Purging; from whence it appears, that all Correctors are not to be eſteemed Alkalies, ſince Acids themſelves prove to be Correctors too. And after a like manner not improbably, the Poyſons of Animals and others may be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued.</p>
                        <p>And it is not improbable, that by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of a Diſtempered Humour with a Medicine a Salutiferous Liquor may be formed, and tho' ſometimes a Medicine is altered before it comes to the part affected, yet that alteration may render it Medicinal: An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the former we have in the Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Mercurius Dulcis,</hi> where by uniting Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with Quick-Silver, an Efficacious Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines is made; and an Illuſtration of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be brought from that Odour which it gives to the Urine of the Perſon who takes it, different from any ſmell it had of it ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                        <p>And tho' againſt what hath been been ſaid, for Specifick Medicines ſome may offer that there are ſome which are only externally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed; yet from what hath been ſaid, of the Poroſity of Bodies and the effects of <hi>Effluvia,</hi> it will eaſily appear how they may influence
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:59609:875"/>the Body, and alter the Humours which cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate in it; and to what is there offered we may reaſonably add, the ill effects of Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets of Arſenick mentioned by <hi>Diemerbreck,</hi> and the effects of <hi>Cantharides</hi> upon ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who only wore them in their Pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets.</p>
                        <p>And indeed there are a great many Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines externally Specificks, which one would not take to be ſo, as Camphire, which inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally is very hot and good in ſome Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Fevers, yet outwardly it is uſed to take off Heat Pimples in the Face, and in cooling Oyntments, and againſt Burns; and Spirit of Wine, tho very hot when internally uſed, yet it, if preſently applyed, takes out the fire of Burns. And ſo mild a Body as Bread, if chewed and outwardly applyed, hath conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Virtues in external affections. And I have ſeveral times eaten a thing without any ſuch effect, which a Phyſician told me exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally applyed would Purge Children, being neither offenſive in colour, ſmell or Gripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                        <p>And to theſe inſtances I ſhall add, That <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> tells us, that an Epileptick Boy was free from ſuch Fits, as long as he wore only Piony Root as an <hi>Appenſum.</hi> And I knew one who was Paralitick, that was ſuddenly relieved in violent Cramps, only by handling the Tooth of a River-Horſe; and I as well as others have been relieved in the Cramp, by putting a Ring made of an Elks Hoof upon my fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. And I knew another cured of an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continentia

Which Tree otherwiſe by its copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fatneſs might be burnt and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
